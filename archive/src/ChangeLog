	compile-cmulisp.lisp:
	o Add some text to explain how to build it.
	o Add support for maxima's describe.
	o Changed the name of the core file to maxima.core.
	
	macdes.lisp:
	o Add $describe for CMUCL.
	
	init_max1.lisp:
	o Changed SYSTEM:: to SI::
	o Set up file extensions appropriately for searching.
	o Update user::run to load up the foreign code so describe works.
	
	mload.lisp:
	o In $file_search, symbols are passed to probe-file and friends.
	  Convert to strings.
	o In new-file-search, pass a string instead of NIL to
	    new-file-search1.
	    
	mactex.lisp:
	o Make tex(1.2e20) work on CMUCL, and change the output to 1.2 \times
	      10^{20} instead of \cdot.
	      
       clmacs.lisp:
        o most-positive-fixnum is too large a count for CMUCL in delq and
	 zl-remove.

	* fix to nparse.lisp for parsing infix and prefix user
	defined operators
	* fix in sin.lisp to fix a bug involving definite integrals
	eg: integrate((sec(t))^2,t,-%pi/4,0);  was incorrect.

Raymond Toy <toy@rtp.ericsson.se>

	SYS-PROCLAIM.lisp:
	o Not sure about these, but some proclaims are definitely wrong.  (I
	  got this from the 5.4 patches on the CMUCL web site.)
	o Put #+gcl around the COMPILER:: symbols
	
	displa.lisp:
	o linearray should be initialized to NIL.
	
	init_max1.lisp:
	o Add CMUCL "version" of getenv.
	
	nparse.lisp:
	o Change occurrences of string-char to #.(array-element-type "a").
	  Wouldn't it have been better to leave string-char everywhere and
	  just do a deftype string-char to base-char for those systems without
	  string-char?
	
	simp.lisp:
	o Don't define the onep macro. It's already a function.  Or maybe get
	  rid of the function and leave the onep macro in?  CMUCL has inline
	  functions so the onep function can be as fast as the macro.
	
	sysdef.lisp:
	o Get the right extensions for :maxima :object-path for CMUCL.
	o I turned off the (safety 0) for CMUCL, but perhaps that's not
	  necessary anymore.

	* Fix to $save
	* I can see this changelog is a bit out of date!!!
	Only 10 years of changes left out of it ...

	* in psmonsubst check that the arg p is not the constant series.
	eg. taylor(x*(1-%e^(2*x)),x,0,0); yields a call where the
	arg is a rational (0 . 1), and so no substitution is necessary.

Sat Nov 11 07:24:45 1989  Bill Schelter  (wfs at nicolas.ma.utexas.edu)

	* There seem to be other problems with resultant:mod;
	We have removed its setting, so that an error will be
	signalled in this mode.
	* misc changes to help file_search
	* describe fixed [it was missing a number of doc items]
	* nutplot added (see nutplot.lisp) for 2d plots with nutmeg


Tue Jul  4 08:11:59 1989  Bill Schelter  (wfs at rascal)

	* fix resultant:mod; option in ufact.lisp.
	Boole was given more than the 3 args mandated by
	common lisp.

Fri Mar 17 18:27:40 1989  Bill Schelter  (wfs at rascal)

	* Remove a #'ncons in trans3.lisp, change defmtrfun
	to refer to defmfun, so that the nargs construct
	will be ok.
	* Fix bug in File_search so that lisp pathname objects
	permitted in the file_search path.
	

Tue Oct 25 02:51:50 1988  Bill Schelter  (wfs at rascal)

	* Added Lazard's trigrat package.
	Added autoloading capability for maxima functions.
	(see max_ext.lisp and autol.lisp)
        Fixed the #$ reader array in commac.lisp to be adjustable.
	Changed primcyclo because cyclotomic can return a fixnum
	(and I think this can happen there). (file factor.lisp).
	

Tue Oct  4 15:54:59 1988  Bill Schelter  (wfs at rascal)

	* nparse.lisp:
	make the parse error swallow further input, and
	print a short message of what was wrong, then
	return to the prompt.   This is for non lispms,
	there we interface with the rubout handler.
	add the tensor/* files to the distribution.
	ctensor.mac has been tested a bit, itensr has not.
	src/maxima-mode.el the gnu emacs maxima mode has been
	improved.

Mon Oct  3 10:07:14 1988  Bill Schelter  (wfs at rascal)

	* spgcd.lisp: determine-lifting-factor had an illegal let*

Sun Oct  2 22:40:19 1988  Bill Schelter  (wfs at rascal)

	* Altered the maxima hash table referencing and setting
	under use_fast_arrays, to use all indicies not just the
	first.   In the end it is probably worth the check
	for more indicies, and to do the consing. files mlisp, acall,ar,array
	* copy-rest-arg a macro (does nothing except on lispm)file:clmacs
	* fixed up the maxima-mode.el somewhat
	* altered let in letmac to be closer to the common lisp let,
	and to allow declares.  Note the order of evaluation
	in a let had been wrong.   It would appear (amazingly) that
	not too much code depends on the order of evaluation there.
	* added special declarations in make-tramp$ (numer.lisp)
	This bug showed up in trying to do romberg(sin(x),x,0,2);
	* changed the mread-synerr syntax error message to not go into the
	debugger.

Thu Sep 29 11:17:35 1988  Bill Schelter  (wfs at rascal)

        Some changes done fairly recently:
	* Numerous changes to bessel to make it work.
	* changes to hyp and hpgeo.lisp to make specint work
	* addition of specint to tests.
	* DOC file changed to allow use of find-doc.el
	a gnu emacs utility (source  for find-doc.el is inside the akcl
	distribution).   Allows completion on doc strings.
	* maxima-mode.el file included for gnu emacs,
	which supports a maxima mode for buffers with
	maxima code, and an inferior-maxima-mode, for
	running maxima inside emacs in a shell or shell
	like window.   Appropriate syntax matching is supplied.
	* makefiles changed to allow them to work on
	systems like HP which don't support the include syntax.
	

Thu Sep 15 16:46:49 1988  Bill Schelter  (wfs at rascal)

	* Fix bug in matcom.lisp (to do with specials and
	rule definitions).
	Misc fixes to mload.
	Fix bug involving complaint about format args
	when trying to print version.  (the file
	src/version.lisp was not always getting loaded)
	
	

Thu Jun 16 12:07:08 1988  Bill Schelter  (wfs at rascal)
	* Fix defn of $status

	* Added autoloading capabilities.  If you load
	autol.lisp and max_ext.lisp, just before dumping
	AND set (get :maxima :object-path) to a full
	pathname then autoloading of things like nusum,..
	should take place.  It may be possible to delete
	a number of sources from the default load.
	

Wed Jun 15 19:46:40 1988  Bill Schelter  (wfs at rascal)

        * Fix example to work.  Add manual.demo to the doc directory.
	
	* Extend alphalessp to make
	numbers<strings<symbols<lists< any other,
	and if x and y aren't in the above types we compare
	the printed representations.

	* ../src/version.lisp was not being loaded in akcl makefile,
	version, causing error in macsyma-top-level, when
	trying to print the version.
	

Tue May 24 09:42:41 1988  Bill Schelter  (wfs at rascal)

	* Changed the $*, $+,.. to use double-float.
	shadow float to be such that (float x) --> double.
	Reader reads doubles by default.  

	* Change the max,min  constants in cpoly.  They needed
	to be doubles.  I left them approximately the same size
	as before (namely used the short-float max min), to avoid
	overflow problems.

	* Verified the test suite. All ok.
