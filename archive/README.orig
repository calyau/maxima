README file for maxima

MAXIMA is a fairly complete computer algebra system.

This system MAXIMA is a COMMON LISP implementation due to William F.
Schelter, and is based on the original implementation of Macsyma at
MIT, as distributed by the Department of Energy.  I now have
permission from DOE to make derivative copies, and in particular to
distribute it under the GNU public license.  See the file COPYING
included in the distribution.   Thus these files may now be redistributed
under the terms of GNU public license.

The known shortfalls of being completely within the common lisp
standard, are several calls to errset.  This can be circumvented but
not completely eliminated.  Also there are some special variables
which need to be proclaimed and then unproclaimed special later.

On most common lisp systems, all necessary files are in the src directory.
Basically one loads the file sysdef.lisp, after having set the directory
paths in that file, and then does a (make :maxima :compile t).  Before
dumping it one does (make :maxima ).   See the file src/compile-clisp.lisp
as an example for doing this in clisp.

BUILDING:
========

If building with GCL (GNU Common Lisp) version 2.0 or later,
edit the file maxima-x.x/configure putting the correct
pathnames in it.  It presupposes your having the .o files from
the GCL available, since a  link will be done to produce a new
image containing maxima.

In the main maxima directory,

% ./configure
% make

This should produce eventually a file maxima/src/saved_maxima

TESTING
=======
To test the system, in the main maxima directory do

% make test

If this completes successfully, then you may wish to eliminate those .o
files no longer needed:

% (cd src ; make clean)

If you wish to eliminate the source to save space and just keep the
necessary .o files, and autoloading .lisp and .mac files, as well as
the documentation, you may

% (cd src ; make eliminate-source)

The maxima/info directory contains a first draft of a manual for maxima.
The make in that directory can produce a .dvi file for printing and
maxima.info for examination in the info system of emacs.   We would MOST
welcome some tutorial and beginner information for this manual.

INSTALLING
==========

After building and possibly removing source and .o files as above,
do

% cd maxima
% make install
to put things in /usr/local (recommended default).

To put things under /public/bin and /public/lib/maxima-5.x.x
you should edit the file 'configure' in the main directory of
the distribution to set up the directories.   Then after doing
configure you can do:

% make install PREFIX_DIR=/public

The MAXIMA_DIRECTORY environment variable will be set to the
maxima library directory, by the executable shell script 'maxima'
which invokes maxima.

Additional information is available at
http://www.ma.utexas.edu/maxima.html

There is now an alternative to the command line version,
which is called xmaxima.   That version runs under MS windows
as well, and has a tcl/tk interface.

If you install in PREFIX_DIR=/public then /public/bin/xmaxima
should get the tcl/tk interface version.
