Maxima uses an external plotting package to make the plots (see the
section on @mref{Plotting Formats}).  The plotting functions calculate a
set of points and pass them to the plotting package together with a set
of commands.  That information can be passed to the external program
either through a pipe or by calling the program with the name of a file
where the data has been saved.  The data file is given the name
@code{maxout_xxx.format}, where @code{xxx} is a number that is unique
to every concurrently-running instance of Maxima and @code{format} is
the name of the plotting format being used (@code{gnuplot},
@code{xmaxima}, @code{mgnuplot}, @code{gnuplot_pipes} or @code{geomview}).

There are to save the plot in a graphic format file. In those cases, the
file @code{maxout_xxx.format} created by Maxima includes commands that will
make the external plotting program save the result in a graphic
file. The default name for that graphic file is
@code{maxplot.extension}, where @code{extension} is the extension
normally used for the kind of graphic file selected.

The @code{maxout_xxx.format} and @code{maxplot.extension} files are created
in the directory specified by the system variable
@mrefdot{maxima_tempdir} That location can be changed by assigning to
that variable (or to the environment variable @env{MAXIMA_TEMPDIR}) a string
that represents a valid directory where Maxima can create new files. The
output of the Maxima plotting command will be a list with the names of
the file(s) created, including their complete path.

If the format used is either @code{gnuplot} or @code{xmaxima}, the
external programs @code{gnuplot} or @code{xmaxima} can be run, giving it
the file @code{maxout_xxx.format} as argument, in order to view again a plot
previously created in Maxima. Thus, when a Maxima plotting command
fails, the format can be set to @code{gnuplot} or @code{xmaxima} and the
plain-text file @code{maxout_xxx.gnuplot} (or @code{maxout_xxx.xmaxima}) can be
inspected to look for the source of the problem.

The additional package @ref{draw} provides functions similar to the ones
described in this section with some extra features. Note that some
plotting options have the same name in both plotting packages, but their
syntax and behavior is different. To view the documentation for a
graphic option @code{opt}, type @code{?? opt} in order to choose the
information for either of those two packages.

@node Plotting Formats, Functions and Variables for Plotting, Introduction to Plotting, Plotting
@section Plotting Formats
@c -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maxima can use either Gnuplot, Xmaxima or Geomview as graphics program. Gnuplot and Geomview are
external programs which must be installed separately, while Xmaxima
is distributed with Maxima. There are various different formats for
those programs, which can be selected with the option @mref{plot_format}
(see also the @mref{Plotting Options} section).

The plotting formats are the following:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@strong{gnuplot} (default on Windows)

Used to launch the external program gnuplot, which must be installed in
your system.  All plotting commands and data are saved into the file
@code{maxout_xxx.gnuplot}.

@item
@strong{gnuplot_pipes} (default on non-Windows platforms)

This format is not available in Windows platforms.
It is similar to the @code{gnuplot} format except that the commands are sent
to gnuplot through a pipe, while the data are saved into the file
@code{maxout_xxx.gnuplot_pipes}.  A single gnuplot process is kept open
and subsequent plot commands will be sent to the same process, replacing
previous plots, unless the gnuplot pipe is closed with the function
@mrefdot{gnuplot_close}  When this format is used, the function
@mref{gnuplot_replot} can be used to modify a plot that has already
displayed on the screen.

This format is only used to plot to the screen; whenever graphic files are
created, the format is silently switched to @code{gnuplot} and
the commands needed to create the graphic file are saved with the data
in file @code{maxout_xxx.gnuplot}.

@item
@strong{mgnuplot}

Mgnuplot is a Tk-based wrapper around gnuplot.  It is included in the
Maxima distribution.  Mgnuplot offers a rudimentary GUI for gnuplot,
but has fewer overall features than the plain gnuplot
interface.  Mgnuplot requires an external gnuplot installation and, in
Unix systems, the Tcl/Tk system.

@item
@strong{xmaxima}

Xmaxima is a Tcl/Tk graphical interface for Maxima that can also be used
to display plots created when Maxima is run from the console or from
other graphical interfaces.  To use this format, the xmaxima program,
which is distributed together with Maxima, must be installed.  If
Maxima is being run from the Xmaxima console, the data and commands are
passed to xmaxima through the same socket used for the communication
between Maxima and the Xmaxima console. When used from a terminal or
from graphical interfaces different from Xmaxima, the commands and data
are saved in the file @code{maxout_xxx.xmaxima} and xmaxima is run with the
name of that file as argument.

In previous versions this format used to be called @code{openmath}; that
old name still works as a synonym for @code{xmaxima}.

@item
@strong{geomview}

Geomview, a Motif based interactive 3D viewing program for Unix, can
also be used to display plots created by Maxima.  To use this format,
the geomview program must be installed.

@c -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@anchor{contour_plot}
@deffn {Function} contour_plot (@var{expr}, @var{x_range}, @var{y_range}, @var{options}, @dots{})

It plots the contours (curves of equal value) of @var{expr}
over the region @var{x_range} by @var{y_range}.
Any additional arguments are treated the same as in @mrefdot{plot3d}

This function only works when the plot format is either @code{gnuplot}
or @code{gnuplot_pipes}.  The additional package
@mrefcomma{implicit_plot} which works in any graphic format, can also be
used to plot contours but a separate expression must be given for each
contour.


Examples:

@c ===beg===
@c contour_plot (x^2 + y^2, [x, -4, 4], [y, -4, 4])$
@c ===end===
@example
(%i1) contour_plot (x^2 + y^2, [x, -4, 4], [y, -4, 4])$
@end example
@ifnotinfo
@image{figures/plotting1,8cm}
@end ifnotinfo

You can add any options accepted by @code{plot3d}; for instance, the
option @mref{legend} with a value of false, to remove the
legend. By default, Gnuplot chooses and displays 3 contours. To increase the
number of contours, it is necessary to use a custom
@mrefcomma{gnuplot_preamble}  as in the next example:

@c ===beg===
@c contour_plot (u^3 + v^2, [u, -4, 4], [v, -4, 4], 
@c               [legend,false],
@c               [gnuplot_preamble, "set cntrparam levels 12"])$
@c ===end===
@example
@group
(%i1) contour_plot (u^3 + v^2, [u, -4, 4], [v, -4, 4],
              [legend,false],
              [gnuplot_preamble, "set cntrparam levels 12"])$

@anchor{geomview_command}
@defvr {System variable} geomview_command

This variable stores the name of the command used to run the geomview
program when the plot format is @code{geomview}. Its default value is
"geomview".  If the geomview program is not found unless you give
its complete path or if you want to try a different version of it,
you may change the value of this variable. For instance,

@c ===beg===
@c geomview_command: "/usr/local/bin/my_geomview"$

@deffn {Function} get_plot_option (@var{keyword}, @var{index})

Returns the current default value of the option named @var{keyword},
which is a list. The optional argument @var{index} must be a positive
integer which can be used to extract only one element from the list
(element 1 is the name of the option).

See also @mrefcomma{set_plot_option} @mref{remove_plot_option} and the
section on Plotting Options.

@c -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@anchor{gnuplot_command}
@defvr {System variable} gnuplot_command

This variable stores the name of the command used to run the gnuplot
program when the plot format is @code{gnuplot}. Its default value is
"gnuplot". If the gnuplot program is not found unless you give its
complete path or if you want to try a different version of it, you
may change the value of this variable. For instance,

@c ===beg===
@c gnuplot_command: "/usr/local/bin/my_gnuplot"$
@c ===end===

@c -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@anchor{gnuplot_file_args}
@defvr {System variable} gnuplot_file_args

When a graphic file is going to be created using @code{gnuplot}, this
variable is used to specify the way the file name should be passed to
gnuplot. Its default value is "~s", which means that the name of the
file will be passed directly. The contents of this variable can be
changed in order to add options for the gnuplot program, adding those
options before the format directive "~s".

@opencatbox
@category{Plotting}
@closecatbox
@end defvr

@c -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@anchor{gnuplot_view_args}
@defvr {System variable} gnuplot_view_args

This variable is used to parse the argument that will be passed to the
gnuplot program when the plot format is @code{gnuplot}. Its default
value is "-persist ~s", where "~s" will be replaced with the name of the
file where the gnuplot commands have been written (usually
"maxout_xxx.gnuplot"). The option @code{-persist} tells gnuplot to exit
after the commands in the file have been executed, without closing the
window that displays the plot.

Those familiar with gnuplot, might want to change the value of this
variable. For example, by changing it to:

@c ===beg===
@c gnuplot_view_args: "~s -"$
@c ===end===
@example
(%i1) gnuplot_view_args: "~s -"$
@end example

gnuplot will not be closed after the commands in the file have been
executed; thus, the window with the plot will remain, as well as the
gnuplot interactive shell where other commands can be issued in order to
modify the plot.

In Windows versions of Gnuplot older than 4.6.3 the behavior of "~s -"
and "-persist ~s" were the opposite; namely, "-persist ~s" made the plot
window and the gnuplot interactive shell remain, while "~s -" closed the
gnuplot shell keeping the plot window. Therefore, when older gnuplot
versions are used in Windows, it might be necessary to adjust the value
of @code{gnuplot_view_args}.

@fname{implicit_plot} ([@var{expr_1}, @dots{}, @var{expr_n}], @var{x_range}, @var{y_range})

Displays a plot of a function on the real plane, defined implicitly by
the expression @var{expr}. The domain in the plane is defined by
@var{x_range} and @var{y_range}. Several functions can be represented on
the same plot, giving a list [@var{expr_1}, @dots{}, @var{expr_n}] of
expressions that define them. This function uses the global format
options set up with the @mrefdot{set_plot_option} Additional options can
also be given as extra arguments for the @code{implicit_plot} command.

The method used by @code{implicit_plot} consists of tracking sign
changes on the domain given and it can fail for complicated expressions.

@code{load(implicit_plot)} loads this function.

Example:
@c ===beg===
@c load(implicit_plot)$
@c implicit_plot (x^2 = y^3 - 3*y + 1, [x, -4, 4], [y, -4, 4])$

@anchor{julia}
@deffn {Function} julia (@var{x}, @var{y}, ...@var{options}...)

Creates a graphic representation of the Julia set for the complex number
(@var{x} + i @var{y}). The two mandatory parameters @var{x} and @var{y}
must be real. This program is part of the additional package
@code{dynamics}, but that package does not have to be loaded; the first
time julia is used, it will be loaded automatically.

Each pixel in the grid is given a color corresponding to the number of
iterations it takes the sequence that starts at that point to move out
of the convergence circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. The number
of pixels in the grid is controlled by the @mref{grid} plot option
(default 30 by 30). The maximum number of iterations is set with the
option @mrefdot{iterations} The program uses its own default palette:
magenta,violet, blue, cyan, green, yellow, orange, red, brown and black,
but it can be changed by adding an explicit @mref{palette} option in the
command.

The default domain used goes from -2 to 2 in both axes and can be
changed with the @code{x} and @code{y} options. By default, the two axes
are shown with the same scale, unless the option @mref{yx_ratio} is used
or the option @mref{same_xy} is disabled. Other general plot options are
also accepted.

The following example shows a region of the Julia set for the number
-0.55 + i0.6. The option @mref{color_bar_tics} is used to prevent
Gnuplot from adjusting the color box up to 40, in which case the points
corresponding the maximum 36 iterations would not be black.

@c ===beg===
@c julia (-0.55, 0.6, [iterations, 36], [x, -0.3, 0.2],

@anchor{make_transform}
@deffn {Function} make_transform ([@var{var1}, @var{var2}, @var{var3}], @var{fx}, @var{fy}, @var{fz})

Returns a function suitable to be used in the option @mref{transform_xy}@w{}
of plot3d.  The three variables @var{var1}, @var{var2}, @var{var3} are
three dummy variable names, which represent the 3 variables given by the
plot3d command (first the two independent variables and then the
function that depends on those two variables).  The three functions
@var{fx}, @var{fy}, @var{fz} must depend only on those 3 variables, and
will give the corresponding x, y and z coordinates that should be
plotted.  There are two transformations defined by default:
@mref{polar_to_xy} and @mrefdot{spherical_to_xyz} See the documentation

@anchor{mandelbrot}
@deffn {Function} mandelbrot (@var{options})

Creates a graphic representation of the Mandelbrot set. This program is
part of the additional package @code{dynamics}, but that package does
not have to be loaded; the first time mandelbrot is used, the package
will be loaded automatically.

This program can be called without any arguments, in which case it will
use a default value of 9 iterations per point, a grid with dimensions
set by the @mref{grid} plot option (default 30 by 30) and a region
that extends from -2 to 2 in both axes. The options are all the same
that plot2d accepts, plus an option @mref{iterations} to change the
number of iterations.

Each pixel in the grid is given a color corresponding to the number of
iterations it takes the sequence starting at zero to move out
of the convergence circle of radius 2, centered at the origin. The
maximum number of iterations is set by the option @mrefdot{iterations}
The program uses its own default palette: magenta,violet, blue, cyan,
green, yellow, orange, red, brown and black, but it can be changed by
adding an explicit @mref{palette} option in the command. By default, the
two axes are shown with the same scale, unless the option @mref{yx_ratio}
is used or the option @mref{same_xy} is disabled.

Example:

@c ===beg===
@c mandelbrot ([iterations, 30], [x, -2, 1], [y, -1.2, 1.2],
            [grid,400,400])$

@fname{plot2d} ([@var{plot_1}, @dots{}, @var{plot_n}], @dots{}, @var{options}, @dots{}) @
@fname{plot2d} ([@var{plot_1}, @dots{}, @var{plot_n}], @var{x_range}, @dots{}, @var{options}, @dots{})

Where @var{plot}, @var{plot_1}, @dots{}, @var{plot_n} can be either
expressions, function names or a list with
the any of the forms: @code{[discrete, [@var{x1}, ..., @var{xn}],
[@var{y1}, ..., @var{yn}]]}, @code{[discrete, [[@var{x1}, @var{y1}],
..., [@var{xn}, ..., @var{yn}]]]} or @code{[parametric, @var{x_expr},
@var{y_expr}, @var{t_range}]}.

Displays a plot of one or more expressions as a function of one
variable or parameter.

@code{plot2d} displays one or several plots in two dimensions.  When
expressions or function name are used to define the plots,
they should all depend on only one variable @var{var} and the use of
@var{x_range} will be mandatory, to provide the name of the variable and
its minimum and maximum values; the syntax for @var{x_range} is:
@code{[@var{variable}, @var{min}, @var{max}]}.

A plot can also be defined in the discrete or parametric forms.  The
discrete form is used to plot a set of points with given coordinates.  A
discrete plot is defined by a list starting with the keyword
@var{discrete}, followed by one or two lists of values.  If two lists are
given, they must have the same length; the first list will be
interpreted as the x coordinates of the points to be plotted and the
second list as the y coordinates.  If only one list is given after the
@var{discrete} keyword, each element on the list could also be a list
with two values that correspond to the x and y coordinates of a point,
or it could be a sequence of numerical values which will be plotted
at consecutive integer values (1,2,3,...) on the x axis.

A parametric plot is defined by a list starting with the keyword
@var{parametric}, followed by two expressions or function names and a
range for the parameter.  The range for the parameter must be a list with
the name of the parameter followed by its minimum and maximum values:
@code{[@var{param}, @var{min}, @var{max}]}.  The plot will show the path
traced out by the point with coordinates given by the two expressions or
functions, as @var{param} increases from @var{min} to @var{max}.

A range for the vertical axis is an optional argument with the form:
@code{[y, @var{min}, @var{max}]} (the keyword @var{y} is always used for
the vertical axis).  If that option is used, the plot will show that
exact vertical range, independently of the values reached by the plot.
If the vertical range is not specified, it will be set up according to
the minimum and maximum values of the second coordinate of the plot
points.

All other options should also be lists, starting with a keyword and
followed by one or more values.  See @mrefdot{plot_options}

If there are several plots to be plotted, a legend will be
written to identity each of the expressions.  The labels that should be
used in that legend can be given with the option @mrefdot{legend}  If that
option is not used, Maxima will create labels from the expressions or
function names.

@c PUT EXAMPLES FOR PRECEDING SIMPLE FORMS OF plot2d HERE
@strong{Examples:}

Plot of a common function:

@c ===beg===
@c plot2d (sin(x), [x, -%pi, %pi])$
@c ===end===
@example
(%i1) plot2d (sin(x), [x, -%pi, %pi])$
@end example

@ifnotinfo
@image{figures/plotting6,8cm}
@end ifnotinfo

If the function grows too fast, it might be necessary to limit the
values in the vertical axis using the @mref{y} option:

@c ===beg===
@c plot2d (sec(x), [x, -2, 2], [y, -20, 20])$
@c ===end===

@end example

@ifnotinfo
@image{figures/plotting7,8cm}
@end ifnotinfo

When the plot box is disabled, no labels are created for the axes. In
that case, instead of using @mref{xlabel} and @mref{ylabel} to set the
names of the axes, it is better to use option @mrefcomma{label} which
allows more flexibility. Option @mref{yx_ratio} is used to change the
default rectangular shape of the plot; in this example the plot will
fill a square.

@c ===beg===
@c plot2d ( x^2 - 1, [x, -3, 3], [box, false], grid2d,
@c      [yx_ratio, 1], [axes, solid], [xtics, -2, 4, 2],

Displays a plot of one or more surfaces defined as functions of two
variables or in parametric form.

The functions to be plotted may be specified as expressions or function names.
The mouse can be used to rotate the plot looking at the surface from different
sides.

@strong{Examples:}

Plot of a function of two variables:

@c ===beg===
@c plot3d (u^2 - v^2, [u, -2, 2], [v, -3, 3], [grid, 100, 100],

Use of the @mref{z} option to limit a function that goes to infinity
 (in this case the function is minus infinity on the x and y axes); this also
shows how to plot with only lines and no shading:

@c ===beg===
@c plot3d ( log ( x^2*y^2 ), [x, -2, 2], [y, -2, 2], [z, -8, 4],
@c          [palette, false], [color, magenta])$
@c ===end===

@end group
@end example

@ifnotinfo
@image{figures/plotting18,8cm}

The infinite values of z can also be avoided by choosing a grid that
does not fall on any points where the function is undefined, as in the
next example, which also shows how to change the palette and how to
include a color bar that relates colors to values of the z variable:

@c ===beg===
@c plot3d (log (x^2*y^2), [x, -2, 2], [y, -2, 2],[grid, 29, 29],
@c       [palette, [gradient, red, orange, yellow, green]],

@anchor{palette}
@defvr  {Plot option} palette @
@fname{palette} [palette, [@var{palette_1}], @dots{}, [@var{palette_n}]] @
@fname{palette} [palette, @var{false}]

It can consist of one palette or a list of several palettes.  Each
palette is a list with a keyword followed by values. If the keyword is
gradient, it should be followed by a list of valid colors.

If the keyword is hue, saturation or value, it must be followed by 4
numbers. The first three numbers, which must be between 0 and 1, define
the hue, saturation and value of a basic color to be assigned to the
minimum value of z. The keyword specifies which of the three attributes
(hue, saturation or value) will be increased according to the values of
z.  The last number indicates the increase corresponding to the maximum
value of z.  That last number can be bigger than 1 or negative; the
corresponding values of the modified attribute will be rounded modulo 1.

Gnuplot only uses the first palette in the list; xmaxima will use the
palettes in the list sequentially, when several surfaces are plotted
together; if the number of palettes is exhausted, they will be repeated
sequentially.

The color of the mesh lines will be given by the option
@mrefdot{mesh_lines_color}  If @code{palette} is given the value
@code{false}, the surfaces will not be shaded but represented with a
mesh of curves only.  In that case, the colors of the lines will be
determined by the option @mrefdot{color}

as complex functions whose real value should be plotted; this is
equivalent to plotting @code{realpart(@var{function})}.  If set to
@code{false}, nothing will be plotted when the function does not give a
real value.  For instance, when @code{x} is negative, @code{log(x)} gives
a complex value, with real value equal to @code{log(abs(x))}; if
@code{plot_realpart} were @code{true}, @code{log(-5)} would be plotted

terminal is @code{default} or when the Gnuplot terminal is set to
@code{dumb} (see @mref{gnuplot_term}) and can have a true or false
value.

If the terminal is @code{default}, a file @code{maxout_xxx.gnuplot} (or
other name specified with @mref{gnuplot_out_file}) is created with the
gnuplot commands necessary to generate the plot. Option @code{run_viewer}
controls whether or not Gnuplot will be launched to execute those
commands and show the plot.

If the terminal is @code{default}, gnuplot is run to execute the
commands in @code{maxout_xxx.gnuplot}, producing another file
@code{maxplot.txt} (or other name specified with
@mref{gnuplot_out_file}). Option @code{run_viewer} controls whether or

The styles that will be used for the various functions or sets of data
in a 2d plot.  The word @var{style} must be followed by one or more
styles.  If there are more functions and data sets than the styles
given, the styles will be repeated.  Each style can be either
@var{lines} for line segments, @var{points} for isolated points,
@var{linespoints} for segments and points, or @var{dots} for small
isolated dots.  Gnuplot accepts also an @var{impulses} style.

Each of the styles can be enclosed inside a list with some additional
parameters.  @var{lines} accepts one or two numbers: the width of the
line and an integer that identifies a color.  The default color codes
are: 1: blue, 2: red, 3: magenta, 4: orange, 5: brown, 6: lime and 7:
aqua.  If you use Gnuplot with a terminal different than X11,
those colors might be different; for example, if you use the option
[@var{gnuplot_term}, @var{ps}], color index 4 will correspond to black,
instead of orange.

@var{points} accepts one two or three parameters; the first parameter
is the radius of the points, the second parameter is an integer that
selects the color, using the same code used for @var{lines} and the
third parameter is currently used only by Gnuplot and it corresponds
to several objects instead of points.  The default types of
objects are: 1: filled circles, 2: open circles, 3: plus signs, 4: x,
5: *, 6: filled squares, 7: open squares, 8: filled triangles, 9: open
triangles, 10: filled inverted triangles, 11: open inverted triangles,
12: filled lozenges and 13: open lozenges.

@var{linespoints} accepts up to four parameters: line width, points
radius, color and type of object to replace the points.

@anchor{gnuplot_term}
@defvr {Plot option} gnuplot_term [gnuplot_term, @var{terminal_name}]

Sets the output terminal type for gnuplot. The argument @var{terminal_name}
can be a string or one of the following 3 special symbols
@itemize @bullet
@item
@strong{default} (default value)

Gnuplot output is displayed in a separate graphical window and the
gnuplot terminal used will be specified by the value of the option
@mrefdot{gnuplot_default_term_command}

@item
@strong{dumb}

Gnuplot output is saved to a file @code{maxout_xxx.gnuplot} using "ASCII
art" approximation to graphics. If the option @mref{gnuplot_out_file} is
set to @var{filename}, the plot will be saved there, instead of the
default @code{maxout_xxx.gnuplot}. The settings for the ``dumb'' terminal of
Gnuplot are given by the value of option
@mrefdot{gnuplot_dumb_term_command} If option @mref{run_viewer} is set
to true and the plot_format is @code{gnuplot} that ASCII representation
will also be shown in the Maxima or Xmaxima console.

@item
@strong{ps}

Gnuplot generates commands in the PostScript page description language.
If the option @mref{gnuplot_out_file} is set to @var{filename}, gnuplot
writes the PostScript commands to @var{filename}.  Otherwise, it is
saved as @code{maxplot.ps} file. The settings for this terminal are given by the value of the option @mrefdot{gnuplot_dumb_term_command}

@item
A string representing any valid gnuplot term specification

Gnuplot can generate output in many other graphical formats such as png,
jpeg, svg etc. To use those formats, option @code{gnuplot_term} can be
set to any supported gnuplot term name (which must be a symbol) or even a
full gnuplot term specification with any valid options (which must be a string).  For
example @code{[gnuplot_term, png]} creates output in PNG (Portable
Network Graphics) format while @code{[gnuplot_term, "png size
1000,1000"]} creates PNG of 1000 x 1000 pixels size.  If the option
@mref{gnuplot_out_file} is set to @var{filename}, gnuplot writes the
output to @var{filename}.  Otherwise, it is saved as
@code{maxplot.@var{term}} file, where @var{term} is gnuplot terminal
name.

It can be used to replace the default name for the file that contains
the commands that will interpreted by gnuplot, when the terminal is set
to @code{default}, or to replace the default name of the graphic file
that gnuplot creates, when the terminal is different from
@code{default}. If it contains one or more slashes, ``/'', the name of
the file will be left as it is; otherwise, it will be appended to the
path of the temporary directory. The complete name of the files created
by the plotting commands is always sent as output of those commands so
they can be seen if the command is ended by semi-colon.

When used in conjunction with the @mref{gnuplot_term} option, it can be
used to save the plot in a file, in one of the graphic formats supported
by Gnuplot. To create PNG, PDF, Postscript or SVG, it is easier to use
