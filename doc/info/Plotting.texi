To make the plots, Maxima can use an external plotting package or its
own graphical interface Xmaxima (see the section on @mref{Plotting
Formats}). The plotting functions calculate a set of points and pass
them to the plotting package together with a set of commands specific to
that graphic program. In some cases those commands and data are saved in
a file and the graphic program is executed giving it the name of that
file to be parsed.

When a file is created, it will begiven the name
@code{maxout_xxx.format}, where @code{xxx} is a number that is unique to
every concurrently-running instance of Maxima and @code{format} is the
name of the plotting format being used (@code{gnuplot}, @code{xmaxima},
@code{mgnuplot} or @code{geomview}).

There are commands to save the plot in a graphic format file, rather
than showing it in the screen. The default name for that graphic file is
@code{maxplot.extension}, where @code{extension} is the extension
normally used for the kind of graphic file selected, but that name can
also be specified by the user.

The @code{maxout_xxx.format} and @code{maxplot.extension} files are created
in the directory specified by the system variable
@mrefdot{maxima_tempdir} That location can be changed by assigning to
that variable (or to the environment variable @env{MAXIMA_TEMPDIR}) a string
that represents a valid directory where Maxima can create new files. The
output of the Maxima plotting command will be a list with the names of
the file(s) created, including their complete path, or empty if no files
are created. Those files should be deleted after the maxima session ends.

If the format used is either @code{gnuplot} or @code{xmaxima}, and the
@code{maxout_xxx.gnuplot} or @code{maxout_xxx.xmaxima} was saved,
@code{gnuplot} or @code{xmaxima} can be run, giving it the name of that
file as argument, in order to view again a plot previously created in
Maxima. Thus, when a Maxima plotting command fails, the format can be
set to @code{gnuplot} or @code{xmaxima} and the plain-text file
@code{maxout_xxx.gnuplot} (or @code{maxout_xxx.xmaxima}) can be
inspected to look for the source of the problem.

The additional package @ref{draw} provides functions similar to the ones
described in this section with some extra features, but it only works
with @code{gnuplot}. Note that some plotting options have the same name
in both plotting packages, but their syntax and behavior is
different. To view the documentation for a graphic option @code{opt},
type @code{?? opt} in order to choose the information for either of
those two packages.

@section Plotting Formats
@c -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maxima can use either Gnuplot, Xmaxima or Geomview as graphics
program. Gnuplot and Geomview are external programs which must be
installed separately, while Xmaxima is distributed with Maxima. To see
which plotting format you are currently using, use the command
@code{get_plot_option(plot_format);} and to change to another format,
you can use @code{set_plot_option([plot_format, <format>])}, where
@code{<format>} is the name of one of the formats described below. Those
two commands show and change the global plot format, while each
individual plotting command can use its own format, if it includes an
option @code{[plot_format, <format>]} (see @mref{get_plot_option} and
@mref{set_plot_option}).

The plotting formats are the following:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@strong{gnuplot} (default on Windows)

Used to launch the external program gnuplot, which must be installed in
your system.  All plotting commands and data are saved into the file
@code{maxout_xxx.gnuplot}.

@item
@strong{gnuplot_pipes} (default on non-Windows platforms)

It is similar to the @code{gnuplot} format except that the commands and
plot data are sent directly to @code{gnuplot} without creating any
files.  A single gnuplot process is kept open, with a single graphic
window, and subsequent plot commands will be sent to the same process,
replacing previous plots in that same window. Even if the graphic window
is closed, the @code{gnuplot} process is still running until the end of
the session or until it is killed with @mrefdot{gnuplot_close}. The
function @mref{gnuplot_replot} can be used to modify a plot that has
already been displayed on the screen or to open again the graphic window
after it was closed.

This format does not work with some versions of Lisp under Windows and
it is only used to plot to the screen; whenever graphic files are to be
created, the format is silently switched to @code{gnuplot} and the
commands needed to create the graphic file are saved with the data in
file @code{maxout_xxx.gnuplot}.

@item
@strong{mgnuplot}

Mgnuplot is a Tk-based wrapper around gnuplot. It is an old interface
still included in the Maxima distribution, but it is currently disabled
because it does not have most of the features introduced by the newer
versions of the plotting commands. Mgnuplot requires an external gnuplot
installation and, in Unix systems, the Tcl/Tk system.

@item
@strong{xmaxima}

Xmaxima is a Tcl/Tk graphical interface for Maxima that can also be used
to display plots created when Maxima is run from the console or from
other graphical interfaces. To use this format, the xmaxima program,
which is distributed together with Maxima, must be installed; in some
Linux distributions Xmaxima is distributed in a package separate from
other parts of Maxima. If Maxima is being run from the Xmaxima console,
the data and commands are passed to xmaxima through the same socket used
for the communication between Maxima and the Xmaxima console. When used
from a terminal or from graphical interfaces different from Xmaxima, the
commands and data are saved in the file @code{maxout_xxx.xmaxima} and
xmaxima is run with the name of that file as argument.

@item
@strong{geomview}

Geomview, a Motif based interactive 3D viewing program for Unix. It can
only be used to display plots created with @code{plot3d}. To use this
format, the geomview program must be installed.

@anchor{geomview_command}
@defvr {System variable} geomview_command

This variable stores the name of the command used to run the geomview
program when the plot format is @code{geomview}. Its default value is
"geomview".  If the geomview program is not found unless you give
its complete path or if you want to try a different version of it,
you may change the value of this variable. For instance,

@c ===beg===
@c geomview_command: "/usr/local/bin/my_geomview"$

@deffn {Function} get_plot_option (@var{keyword}, @var{index})

Returns the current default value of the option named @var{keyword},
which is a list. The optional argument @var{index} must be a positive
integer which can be used to extract only one element from the list
(element 1 is the name of the option).

See also @mrefcomma{set_plot_option} @mref{remove_plot_option} and the
section on @mrefdot{Plotting Options}

@anchor{gnuplot_command}
@defvr {System variable} gnuplot_command

This variable stores the name of the command used to run the gnuplot
program when the plot format is @code{gnuplot} or
@code{gnuplot_pipes}. Its default value is "gnuplot". If the gnuplot
program is not found unless you give its complete path or if you want to
try a different version of it, you may change the value of this
variable. For instance,

@c ===beg===
@c gnuplot_command: "/usr/local/bin/my_gnuplot"$

@c -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@anchor{gnuplot_file_args}
@defvr {System variable} gnuplot_file_args

When a graphic file is going to be created using @code{gnuplot}, this
variable is used to specify the format used to print the file name given
to gnuplot. Its default value is "~a" in SBCL and Openmcl, and "~s" in
other lisp versions, which means that the name of the file will be
passed without quotes if SBCL or Openmcl are used and within quotes if
other Lisp versions are used. The contents of this variable can be
changed in order to add options for the gnuplot program, adding those
options before the format directive "~s".

@opencatbox
@category{Plotting}
@closecatbox
@end defvr

@c -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@anchor{gnuplot_view_args}
@defvr {System variable} gnuplot_view_args

This variable is the format used to parse the argument that will be
passed to the gnuplot program when the plot format is
@code{gnuplot}. Its default value is "-persist ~a" when SBCL or Openmcl
are used, and "-persist ~s" with other Lisp variants, where "~a" or "~s"
will be replaced with the name of the file where the gnuplot commands
have been written (usually "maxout_xxx.gnuplot"). The option
@code{-persist} tells gnuplot to exit after the commands in the file
have been executed, without closing the window that displays the plot.

Those familiar with gnuplot, might want to change the value of this
variable. For example, by changing it to:

@c ===beg===
@c gnuplot_view_args: "~s -"$
@c ===end===
@example
(%i1) gnuplot_view_args: "~s -"$
@end example

gnuplot will not be closed after the commands in the file have been
executed; thus, the window with the plot will remain, as well as the
gnuplot interactive shell where other commands can be issued in order to
modify the plot.

In Windows versions of Gnuplot older than 4.6.3 the behavior of "~s -"
and "-persist ~s" were the opposite; namely, "-persist ~s" made the plot
window and the gnuplot interactive shell remain, while "~s -" closed the
gnuplot shell keeping the plot window. Therefore, when older gnuplot
versions are used in Windows, it might be necessary to adjust the value
of @code{gnuplot_view_args}.

@anchor{julia}
@deffn {Function} julia (@var{x}, @var{y}, ...@var{options}...)

Creates a graphic representation of the Julia set for the complex number
(@var{x} + i @var{y}). The two mandatory parameters @var{x} and @var{y}
must be real. This program is part of the additional package
@code{dynamics}, but that package does not have to be loaded; the first
time julia is used, it will be loaded automatically.

Each pixel in the grid is given a color corresponding to the number of
iterations it takes the sequence that starts at that point to move out
of the convergence circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. The number
of pixels in the grid is controlled by the @mref{grid} plot option
(default 30 by 30). The maximum number of iterations is set with the
option @mrefdot{iterations} The program sets its own default palette:
magenta, violet, blue, cyan, green, yellow, orange, red, brown and black,
but it can be changed by adding an explicit @mref{palette} option in the
command.

The default domain used goes from -2 to 2 in both axes and can be
changed with the @code{x} and @code{y} options. By default, the two axes
are shown with the same scale, unless the option @mref{yx_ratio} is used
or the option @mref{same_xy} is disabled. Other general plot options are
also accepted.

The following example shows a region of the Julia set for the number
-0.55 + i0.6. The option @mref{color_bar_tics} is used to prevent
Gnuplot from adjusting the color box up to 40, in which case the points
corresponding the maximum 36 iterations would not be black.

@c ===beg===
@c julia (-0.55, 0.6, [iterations, 36], [x, -0.3, 0.2],

@anchor{make_transform}
@deffn {Function} make_transform ([@var{var1}, @var{var2}, @var{var3}], @var{fx}, @var{fy}, @var{fz})

Returns a function suitable to be used in the option @mref{transform_xy}@w{}
of plot3d.  The three variables @var{var1}, @var{var2}, @var{var3} are
three dummy variable names, which represent the 3 variables given by the
plot3d command (first the two independent variables and then the
function that depends on those two variables).  The three functions
@var{fx}, @var{fy}, @var{fz} must depend only on those 3 variables, and
will give the corresponding x, y and z coordinates that should be
plotted.  There are two transformations defined by default:
@mref{polar_to_xy} and @mrefdot{spherical_to_xyz} See the documentation
for those two transformations.

@anchor{mandelbrot}
@deffn {Function} mandelbrot (@var{options})

Creates a graphic representation of the Mandelbrot set. This program is
part of the additional package @code{dynamics}, but that package does
not have to be loaded; the first time mandelbrot is used, the package
will be loaded automatically.

This program can be called without any arguments, in which case it will
use a default value of 9 iterations per point, a grid with dimensions
set by the @mref{grid} plot option (default 30 by 30) and a region
that extends from -2 to 2 in both axes. The options are all the same
that plot2d accepts, plus an option @mref{iterations} to change the
number of iterations.

Each pixel in the grid is given a color corresponding to the number of
iterations it takes the sequence starting at zero to move out
of the convergence circle of radius 2, centered at the origin. The
maximum number of iterations is set by the option @mrefdot{iterations}
The program uses its own default palette: magenta,violet, blue, cyan,
green, yellow, orange, red, brown and black, but it can be changed by
adding an explicit @mref{palette} option in the command. By default, the
two axes are shown with the same scale, unless the option @mref{yx_ratio}
is used or the option @mref{same_xy} is disabled.

Example:

@c ===beg===
@c mandelbrot ([iterations, 30], [x, -2, 1], [y, -1.2, 1.2],
            [grid,400,400])$

plot3d as the distance from the z axis and the azimuthal angle (polar
coordinates), and transform them into x and y coordinates.

@fname{plot2d} ([@var{type_1}, @dots{}, @var{type_n}], @var{options})

There are 5 types of plots that can be plotted by @code{plot2d}:

@enumerate
@item @b{Explicit functions}. @code{plot2d} (@var{expr}, @var{range_x},
@var{options}), where @var{expr} is an expression that depends on only
one variable, or the name of a function with one input parameter and
numerical results. @var{range_x} is a list with three elements, the
first one being the name of the variable that will be shown on the
horizontal axis of the plot, and the other two elements should be two
numbers, the first one smaller than the second, that define the minimum
and maximum values to be shown on the horizontal axis. The name of the
variable used in @var{range_x} must be the same variable on which
@var{expr} depends. The result will show in the vertical axis the
corresponding values of the expression or function for each value of the
variable in the horizontal axis.

@item @b{Implicit functions}. @code{plot2d} (@var{expr_1}=@var{expr_2},
@var{range_x}, @var{range_y}, @var{options}), where @var{expr_1} and
@var{expr_2} are two expressions that can depend on one or two
variables. @var{range_x} and @var{range_y} must be two lists of three
elements that define the ranges for the variables in the two axes of the
plot; the first element of each list is the name of the corresponding
variable, and the other two elements are the minimum and maximum values
for that variable. The two variables on which @var{expr_1} and
@var{expr_2} can depend are those specified by @var{range_x} and
@var{range_y}. The result will be a curve or a set of curves where the
equation @var{expr_1}=@var{expr_2} is true.

@item @b{Parametric functions}. @code{plot2d} ([parametric,
@var{expr_x}, @var{expr}_y, @var{range}], @var{options}), where
@var{expr_x} and @var{expr}_y are two expressions that depend on a
single parameter. @var{range} must be a three-element list; the first
element must be the name of the parameter on which @var{expr_x} and
@var{expr}_y depend, and the other two elements must be the minimum and
maximum values for that parameter. The result will be a curve in which
the horizontal and vertical coordinates of each point are the values of
@var{expr_x} and @var{expr}_y for a value of the parameter within the
range given.

@item @b{Set of points}. @code{plot2d} ([discrete, @var{points}],
@var{options}), displays a list of points, joined by segments by
default. The horizontal and vertical coordinates of each of those points
can be specified in three different ways: With two lists of the same
length, in which the elements of the first list are the horizontal
coordinates of the points and the second list are the vertical
coordinates, or with a list of two-element lists, each one corresponding
to the two coordinates of one of the points, or with a single list that
defines the vertical coordinates of the points; in this last case, the
horizontal coordinates of the n points will be assumed to be the first n
natural numbers.

@item @b{Contour lines}. @code{plot2d} ([contour, @var{expr}],
@var{range_x}, @var{range_y}, @var{options}), where @var{expr} is an
expression that depends on two variables. @var{range_x} and
@var{range_y} will be lists whose first elements are the names of those
two variables, followed by two numbers that set the minimum and maximum
values for them. The first variable will be represented along the
horizontal axis and the second along the vertical axis. The result will
be a set of curves along which the given expression has certain
values. If those values are not specified with the option @code{levels},
plotd2d will try to choose, at the most, 8 values of the form d*10^n, where d is
either 1, 2 or 5, all of them within the minimum and maximum values of
@var{expr} within the given ranges.
@end enumerate

At the end of a plot2d command several of the options described in
@mref{Plotting Options} can be used. Many instances of the 5 types
described above can be combined into a single plot, by putting them
inside a list: @code{plot2d} ([@var{type_1}, @dots{}, @var{type_n}],
@var{options}). If one of the types included in the list require
@var{range_x} or @var{range_y}, those ranges should come immediately
after the list.

If there are several plots to be plotted, a legend will be
written to identity each of the expressions.  The labels that should be
used in that legend can be given with the option @mrefdot{legend}  If that
option is not used, Maxima will create labels from the expressions or
function names.

When the plot box is disabled, no labels are created for the axes. In
that case, instead of using @mref{xlabel} and @mref{ylabel} to set the
names of the axes, it is better to use option @mrefcomma{label} which

Displays a plot of one or more surfaces defined as functions of two
variables or in parametric form.

The functions to be plotted may be specified as expressions or function names.
The mouse can be used to rotate the plot looking at the surface from different
sides.

@strong{Examples}.

Plot of a function of two variables:

@c ===beg===
@c plot3d (u^2 - v^2, [u, -2, 2], [v, -3, 3], [grid, 100, 100],

Use of the @mref{z} option to limit a function that goes to infinity
 (in this case the function is minus infinity on the x and y axes); this also
shows how to plot with only lines and no shading:

@c ===beg===
@c plot3d ( log ( x^2*y^2 ), [x, -2, 2], [y, -2, 2], [z, -8, 4],
@c          nopalette, [color, magenta])$
@c ===end===
@example
@group
(%i1) plot3d ( log ( x^2*y^2 ), [x, -2, 2], [y, -2, 2], [z, -8, 4],
         nopalette, [color, magenta])$
@end group
@end example

@ifnotinfo

The infinite values of z can also be avoided by choosing a grid that
does not fall on any points where the function is undefined, as in the
next example, which also shows how to change the palette and how to
include a color bar that relates colors to values of the z variable:

@c ===beg===
@c plot3d (log (x^2*y^2), [x, -2, 2], [y, -2, 2],[grid, 29, 29],
@c       [palette, [gradient, red, orange, yellow, green]],

Two surfaces in the same plot. Ranges specific to one of the surfaces can
be given by placing each expression and its ranges in a separate list;
global ranges for the complete plot are also given after the function
definitions.

All options consist of a list starting with one of the keywords in this
section, followed by one or more values. If the option appears inside
one of the plotting commands, its value will be local for that
command. It the option is given as argument to
@mrefcomma{set_plot_option} its value will be global and used in all
plots, unless it is overridden by a local value.

Some of the options may have different effects in different plotting
commands as it will be pointed out in the following list. The options
that accept among their possible values true or false, can also be set
to true by simply writing their names, and false by writing their names
with the prefix no. For instance, typing @code{logx} as an option is
equivalent to writing @code{[logx, true]} and @code{nobox} is equivalent
to @code{[box, false]}. When just the name of the option is used for an
option which cannot have a value @code{true}, it means that any value
previously assigned to that option will be removed, leaving it to the
graphic program to decide what to do.

@c -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@anchor{adapt_depth}
@defvr {Plot option} adapt_depth [adapt_depth, @var{integer}]
Default value: @code{5}

The maximum number of splittings used by the adaptive plotting routine
of @mref{plot2d}; @var{integer} must be a non-negative integer. A value
of zero means that adaptive plotting will not be used and the resulting
plot will have 1+4*@var{nticks} points (see option @mref{nticks}). To
have more control on the number of points and their positions, a list of
points can be created and then plotted using the @code{discrete} method
of @code{plot2d}.

If there are more curves or surfaces than colors, the colors will be
repeated in sequence. The valid colors are @code{red}, @code{green},
@code{blue}, @code{magenta}, @code{cyan}, @code{yellow}, @code{orange},
@code{violet}, @code{brown}, @code{gray}, @code{black}, @code{white}, or

This option is used by @mref{plot2d} to do contour plots. If only one
number is given after the keyword @code{levels}, it must be a natural
number; @code{plot2d} will try to plot that number of contours with
values between the minimum and maximum value of the expression given,
with the form d*10^n, where d is either 1, 2 or 5. Since not always it will
be possible to find that number of levels in that interval, the number of
contour lines show will be smaller than the number specified by this
option.

If more than one number are given after the keyword @code{levels},
@mrefdot{plot2d} will show the contour lines corresponding to those
values of the expression plotted, if they exist within the domain used.

@anchor{palette}
@defvr  {Plot option} palette @
[palette, [@var{palette_1}], @dots{}, [@var{palette_n}]], palette, nopalette

It can consist of one palette or a list of several palettes.  Each
palette is a list with a keyword followed by values. If the keyword is
gradient, it should be followed by a list of valid colors.

If the keyword is hue, saturation or value, it must be followed by 4
numbers. The first three numbers, which must be between 0 and 1, define
the hue, saturation and value of a basic color to be assigned to the
minimum value of z. The keyword specifies which of the three attributes
(hue, saturation or value) will be increased according to the values of
z.  The last number indicates the increase corresponding to the maximum
value of z.  That last number can be bigger than 1 or negative; the
corresponding values of the modified attribute will be rounded modulo 1.

Gnuplot only uses the first palette in the list; xmaxima will use the
palettes in the list sequentially, when several surfaces are plotted
together; if the number of palettes is exhausted, they will be repeated
sequentially.

The color of the mesh lines will be given by the option
@mrefdot{mesh_lines_color} If @code{palette} is given the value
@code{false}, the surfaces will not be shaded but represented with a
mesh of curves only. In that case, the colors of the lines will be
determined by the option @mrefdot{color}

The single keyword @code{palette} removes any palette previously
defined, leaving it to the graphic program to decide the palette to use
and @code{nopalette} is a synonym for @code{[palette, false]}.

@anchor{plotepsilon}
@defvr {Plot option} plotepsilon [plotepsilon, @var{value}]

Default value: 1e-6

This value is used by @mref{plot2d} when plotting implicit functions or
contour lines. When plotting an explicit function @code{expr_1=expr_2},
it is converted into @code{expr_1-expr_2} and the points where that equals
zero are searched. When a contour line for @code{expr} equal to some value
is going to be plotted, the points where @code{expr} minus that value
are equal to zero are searched. The search is done by computing those
expressions at a grid of points (see @mref{sample}). If at one of the
points in that grid the absolute value of the expression is less than
the value of @code{plotepsilon}, it will be assumed to be zero, and
therefore, as being part of the curve to be plotted.

Default value: @code{false}

If set to @code{true}, the functions to be plotted will be considered as
complex functions whose real value should be plotted; this is equivalent
to plotting @code{realpart(@var{function})}.  If set to @code{false},
nothing will be plotted when the function does not give a real value.
For instance, when @code{x} is negative, @code{log(x)} gives a complex
value, with real value equal to @code{log(abs(x))}; if
@code{plot_realpart} were @code{true}, @code{log(-5)} would be plotted
as @code{log(5)}, while nothing would be plotted if @code{plot_realpart}
were @code{false}. The single keyword @code{plot_realpart} can be used

This option is only used when the plot format is @code{gnuplot} and the
terminal is @code{default} or when the Gnuplot terminal is set to
@code{dumb} (see @mref{gnuplot_term}) and can have a true or false
value.

If the terminal is @code{default}, a file @code{maxout_xxx.gnuplot} (or
other name specified with @mref{gnuplot_out_file}) is created with the
gnuplot commands necessary to generate the plot. Option @code{run_viewer}
controls whether or not Gnuplot will be launched to execute those
commands and show the plot.

If the terminal is @code{default}, gnuplot is run to execute the
commands in @code{maxout_xxx.gnuplot}, producing another file
@code{maxplot.txt} (or other name specified with
@mref{gnuplot_out_file}). Option @code{run_viewer} controls whether or
not that file, with an ASCII representation of the plot, will be shown
in the Maxima or Xmaxima console.

Its default value, true, makes the plots appear in either the console or

@defvr {Plot option} sample [sample, @var{nx}, @var{ny}]

Default value: @code{[sample, 50, 50]}

@var{nx} and @var{ny} must be two natural numbers that will be used by
@mref{plot2d} to look for the points that make part of the plot of an
implicit function or a contour line. The domain is divided into @var{nx}
intervals in the horizontal axis and @var{ny} intervals in the vertical
axis and the numerical value of the expression is computed at the
borders of those intervals. Higher values of @var{nx} and @var{ny} will
give smoother curves, but will increase the time needed to trace the
plot. When there are critical points in the plot where the curve changes
direction, to get better results it is more important to try to make
those points to be at the border of the intervals, rather than
increasing @var{nx} and @var{ny}.

The styles that will be used for the various functions or sets of data
in a 2d plot.  The word @var{style} must be followed by one or more
styles.  If there are more functions and data sets than the styles
given, the styles will be repeated.  Each style can be either
@var{lines} for line segments, @var{points} for isolated points,
@var{linespoints} for segments and points, or @var{dots} for small
isolated dots.  Gnuplot accepts also an @var{impulses} style.

Each of the styles can be enclosed inside a list with some additional
parameters.  @var{lines} accepts one or two numbers: the width of the
line and an integer that identifies a color.  The default color codes
are: 1: blue, 2: red, 3: magenta, 4: orange, 5: brown, 6: lime and 7:
aqua.  If you use Gnuplot with a terminal different than X11,
those colors might be different; for example, if you use the option
[@var{gnuplot_term}, @var{ps}], color index 4 will correspond to black,
instead of orange.

@var{points} accepts one two or three parameters; the first parameter
is the radius of the points, the second parameter is an integer that
selects the color, using the same code used for @var{lines} and the
third parameter is currently used only by Gnuplot and it corresponds
to several objects instead of points.  The default types of
objects are: 1: filled circles, 2: open circles, 3: plus signs, 4: x,
5: *, 6: filled squares, 7: open squares, 8: filled triangles, 9: open
triangles, 10: filled inverted triangles, 11: open inverted triangles,
12: filled lozenges and 13: open lozenges.

@var{linespoints} accepts up to four parameters: line width, points
radius, color and type of object to replace the points.

example @code{[gnuplot_term, png]} creates output in PNG (Portable
Network Graphics) format while @code{[gnuplot_term, "png size
1000,1000"]} creates PNG of 1000 x 1000 pixels size.  If the option
@mref{gnuplot_out_file} is set to @var{filename}, gnuplot writes the
output to @var{filename}.  Otherwise, it is saved as
@code{maxplot.@var{term}} file, where @var{term} is gnuplot terminal
name.

@c -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@anchor{gnuplot_out_file}
@defvr {Plot option} gnuplot_out_file [gnuplot_out_file, @var{file_name}]

It can be used to replace the default name for the file that contains
the commands that will interpreted by gnuplot, when the terminal is set
to @code{default}, or to replace the default name of the graphic file
that gnuplot creates, when the terminal is different from
@code{default}. If it contains one or more slashes, ``/'', the name of
the file will be left as it is; otherwise, it will be appended to the
path of the temporary directory. The complete name of the files created
by the plotting commands is always sent as output of those commands so
they can be seen if the command is ended by semi-colon.

When used in conjunction with the @mref{gnuplot_term} option, it can be
used to save the plot in a file, in one of the graphic formats supported
by Gnuplot. To create PNG, PDF, Postscript or SVG, it is easier to use
options @mrefcomma{png_file} @mrefcomma{pdf_file} @mrefcomma{ps_file}
or @mrefdot{svg_file}

     @c -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@anchor{gnuplot_script_file}
@defvr {Plot option} gnuplot_script_file [gnuplot_script_file, @var{file_name_or_function}]

Set the name of the script file created by @code{plot2d} or @code{plot3d}
when the @mref{plot_format} is @code{gnuplot}. The value
@var{file_name_or_function} can be a string or a Maxima function of one
variable that returns a string.

In this example, the script file name is set to ``sin.gnuplot''.

@example
(%i1) plot2d( sin(x), [x,0,2*%pi], [gnuplot_script_file, "sin.gnuplot"]);

(%o1) ["/tmp/sin.gnuplot"]
@end example

In this example, @code{gnuplot_maxout_prt(@var{file})} is a function
that takes the default file name, @var{file}. It constructs a full file
name for the data file by interpolating a random 8-digit integer with a
pad of zeros into the default file name. The directory is determined by
@mref{maxima_tempdir} (it is ``/tmp'' in this example).

@example
(%i1) gnuplot_maxout_prt(file) := block([beg,end],
        [beg,end] : split(file,"."),
        printf(false,"~a_~8,'0d.~a",beg,random(10^8-1),end)) $

(%i2) plot2d( sin(x), [x,0,2*%pi], [gnuplot_script_file, gnuplot_maxout_prt]);

(%o2) ["/tmp/maxout68715_09606909.gnuplot"]
@end example

By default, the script would have been saved in a file named
@code{maxoutXXXXX.gnuplot} (XXXXX=68715 in this example).

formatting characters and their meaning, see the documentation for enhanced
in Gnuplot. The default value for this option is @code{false}, which will
not treat any characters as formatting characters.
