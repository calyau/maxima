@deffn {Function} hompack_polsys (@var{eqnlist}, @var{varlist} [, @var{iflg1}, @var{epsbig}, @var{epssml}, @var{numrr}])
Finds the roots of the system of polynomials in the variables
@var{varlist} in the system of equations in @var{eqnlist}.  The number
of equations must match number of variables.  Each equation must be a
polynomial with variables in @var{varlist}.  The coefficients must be
real numbers.

The optional keyword arguments provide some control over the
algorithm.  @var{epsbig} is the local error tolerance allowed by the
path tracker, defaulting to 1e-4.  @var{epssml} is the accuracy
desired for the final solution, defaulting to 1d-14.. @var{iflg1},
defaulting to 0, controls the algorithm as follows:
@table @code
@item 0
If the problem is to be solved without calling @code{polsys}' scaling
routine, @code{sclgnp}, and without using the projective
transformation.
@item 1
If scaling but no projective transformation is to be used.
@item 10
If no scaling but projective transformation is to be used.
@item 11
If both scaling and projective transformation are to be used.
@end table

@code{hompack_polsys} returns a list.  The elements of the list are:
@table @code
@item retcode
Indicates whether the solution is valid or not.
@table @code
@item 0
Solution found without problems
@item 1
Solution succeeded but @code{iflg2} indicates some issues with a
root. (That is, @code{iflg2} is not all ones.)
@item -1
@code{NN}, the declared dimension of the number of terms in the
polynomials,  is too small.  (This should not happen.)
@item -2
@code{MMAXT}, the declared dimension for the internal coefficient and
degree arrays, is too small.  (This should not happen.)
@item -3
@code{TTOTDG}, the total degree of the equations,  is too small.
(This should not happen.)
@item -4
@code{LENWK}, the length of the internal real work array, is too
small.  (This should not happen.)
@item -5
@code{LENIWK}, the length of the internal integer work array, is too
small.  (This should not happen.)
@item -6
@var{iflg1} is not 0 or 1, or 10 or 11.  (This should not happen; an
error should be thrown before @code{polsys} is called.)
@end table
@item roots
The roots of the system of equations.  This is in the same format as
@code{solve} would return.
@item iflg2
Information on how the path for the m'th root terminated:
@table @code
@item 1
Normal return
@item 2
Specified error tolerance cannot be met.  Increase @var{epsbig} and
@var{epssml}  and rerun.
@item 3
Maximum number of steps exceeded.  To track the path further, increase
@var{numrr} and rerun the path.  However, the path may be diverging, if the
lambda value is near 1 and the roots values are large.
@item 4
Jacobian matrix does not have full rank.  The algorithm has failed
(the zero curve of the homotopy map cannot be followed any further).
@item 5
The tracking algorithm has lost the zero curve of the homotopy map and
is not making progress.  The error tolerances @var{epsbig} and
@var{epssml} were too lenient.  The problem should be restarted with
smaller error tolerances.
@item 6
The normal flow newton iteration in @code{stepnf} or @code{rootnf}
failed to converge.  The error tolerance @var{epsbig} may be too
stringent.
@item 7
Illegal input parameters, a fatal error.
@end table
@item lambda
The final lambda value for the m-th root, where lambda is the
continuation parameter.
@item arclen
The arc length of the m-th root.
@item nfe
The number of jacobian matrix evaluations required to track the m-th
root.
@end table

@example
(%i1) hompack_polsys([x1^2-1, x2^2-2],[x1,x2]);
(%o1) [0,
       [[x1 = (-1.354505666901954e-16*%i)-0.9999999999999999,
         x2 = 3.52147935979316e-16*%i-1.414213562373095],
        [x1 = 1.0-5.536432658639868e-18*%i,
         x2 = (-4.213674137126362e-17*%i)-1.414213562373095],
        [x1 = (-9.475939894034927e-17*%i)-1.0,
         x2 = 2.669654624736742e-16*%i+1.414213562373095],
        [x1 = 9.921253413273088e-18*%i+1.0,
         x2 = 1.414213562373095-5.305667769855424e-17*%i]],[1,1,1,1],
       [1.0,1.0,0.9999999999999996,1.0],
       [4.612623769341193,4.612623010859902,4.612623872939383,
        4.612623114484402],[40,40,40,40]]
@end example

The analytical solution can be obtained with solve:
@example
(%i2) solve([x1^2-1, x2^2-2],[x1,x2]);
(%o2) [[x1 = 1,x2 = -sqrt(2)],[x1 = 1,x2 = sqrt(2)],[x1 = -1,x2 = -sqrt(2)],
        [x1 = -1,x2 = sqrt(2)]]
@end example
We see that @code{hompack_polsys} returned the correct answer except
that the roots are in a different order and there is a small imaginary
part.

Another example, with corresponding solution from solve:
@example
(%i1) hompack_polsys([x1^2 + 2*x2^2 + x1*x2 - 5, 2*x1^2 + x2^2 + x2-4],[x1,x2]);
(%o1) [0,
       [[x1 = 1.201557301700783-1.004786320788336e-15*%i,

        [x1 = 1.871959754090949e-16*%i-1.428529189565313,
         x2 = (-6.301586314393093e-17*%i)-0.9106199083334113],
        [x1 = 0.5920619420732697-1.942890293094024e-16*%i,

        [x1 = 7.363503717463654e-17*%i+0.08945540033671608,

        5.611474283583368],[35,41,48,40]]
(%i2) solve([x1^2+2*x2^2+x1*x2 - 5, 2*x1^2+x2^2+x2-4],[x1,x2]);
(%o2) [[x1 = 0.08945540336850383,x2 = 1.557667386609071],
       [x1 = 0.5920619554695062,x2 = 1.383859286083807],
       [x1 = 1.201557352500749,x2 = -1.66727025803531],
       [x1 = -1.428529150636283,x2 = -0.9106198942815954]]
@end example

Note that @code{hompack_polsys} can sometimes be very slow.  Perhaps
@code{solve} can be used.  Or perhaps @code{eliminate} can be used to
convert the system of polynomials into one polynomial for which
@code{allroots} can find all the roots.
