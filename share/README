Filename share/README

Packages in the contrib directory are considered external to Maxima;
see the README file in that directory.
The remaining directories and packages might be part of the Maxima
distribution but are placed here because they are considered additional
packages not used very often, or because they are still in the
development phase. Once they are stable they might be moved to the
main distribution or the may be made automatically loadable when needed.
