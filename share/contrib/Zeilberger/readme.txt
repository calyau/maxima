--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implementation Zeilberger's algorithm for
definite hypergeometric summation and of 
Gosper's algorithm for indefinite hypergeometric

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEMS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE INDEFINITE PROBLEM

The package provides an implementation of Gosper's algorithm
for indefinite hypergeometric summation:

Given a hypergeometric term F_k in k we want to find its hypergeometric
anti-difference, i.e. a hypergeometric term f_k such that:

F_k = f_(k+1) - f_k.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE DEFINITE PROBLEM

The package provides an implementation of Zeilberger's algorithm
for definite hypergeometric summation:

Given a proper hypergeometric term (in n and k) F_(n,k) and a
positive integer d we want to find a d-th order linear
recurrence with polynomial coefficients (in n) for F_(n,k)
and a rational function R in n and k such that:

a_0 F_(n,k) + ... + a_d F_(n+d),k = Delta_K(R(n,k) F_(n,k)),

where

Delta_k is the k-forward difference operator, i.e.,
Delta_k(t_k) := t_(k+1) - t_k.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
LOADING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to load the package 
either load all the ".mac" files manually or 
first edit the line of "zeilberger.mac" defining 
the directory ("dir") containing the
package files, then load "zeilberger.mac" 
which will take care of loading and evaluating
all the necessary files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- AntiDifference(F_k,k)

AntiDifference either finds the hypergeometric anti-difference
of F_k if it exists, or if it does not exist, it outputs:
NO_HYP_ANTIDIFFERENCE

If the input is not hypergeometric it outputs:
NON_HYPERGEOMETRIC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Gosper(F_k,k)

Gosper either finds the rational certificate R(k) for F_k, i.e.
a rational function such that:

F_k = R(k+1) F_(k+1) - R(k) F_k
 
if it exists, or if it does not exist, it outputs:
NO_HYP_SOL

If the input is not hypergeometric it outputs:
NON_HYPERGEOMETRIC
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- GosperSum(F_k,k,a,b) 

GosperSum either sums F_k over the interval [a,b] if
F_k has a hypergeometric anti-difference, or 
if it does not have it, it outpus:
NONGOSPER_SUMMABLE

If the input is not hypergeometric it outputs:
NON_HYPERGEOMETRIC
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- parGosper(F_n,k,n,d)

parGosper tries to find a d-th order recurrence.
If it finds one it outputs it in the form (*).
If it finds none it outputs the empty solution [].

If the input is not proper hypergeometric in k and n it outputs:
[NON_PROPER_HYPERGEOMETRIC]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Zeilberger(F_n,k,n)

- Zeilberger(F_n,k,n,d) [same as "parGosper(F_n,k,n,d)"]

Zeilberger starts by invoking "Gosper" and if it fails
tries "parGosper" with order 1 and tries up to 
the order given by the variable MAX_ORD.
If Zeilberger finds a solution before reaching MAX_ORD
it stops and yields the solution in the form (*) otherwise
it tries a higher order.
If no solution is found it outputs [].

If the input is not proper hypergeometric in k and n it outputs:
[NON_PROPER_HYPERGEOMETRIC]

Remark: "Gosper" is skipped if the setting
GOSPER_IN_ZEILBERGER is set to FALSE.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

(*)
FORM OF THE OUTPUT OF "parGosper" AND "ZEILBERGER"

The algorithms yields a sequence:
[s_1,s_2, ..., s_m] of solutions.

Each solution has the following form:

[R(n,k), [a_0, a_1, ..., a_d]] 

---------------------------------------------
AUTHOMATIC PROVERS OF RECURRENCES/IDENTITIES


Starting with version 4.0, I have included some routines
that produce formal simple human-readable out of the 
output of "Gosper", "parGosper" and "Zeilberger".
This is very simple because the output contains a
so-called "rational certificate" 

Level of details in the proofs and test:
The level of details of the proves depend on the
variables "gs_prove_detail" and "zb_prove_detail",
whose values can range in the set:
{PROOF_SILENT,PROOF_LOW,PROOF_MEDIUM,PROOF_HIGH}.


- gs_prove(F_k,k,cert)

It produces a proof for the output "cert" of "Gosper(F_k,k)",
with level of details depending on the value of "gs_prove_detail".

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- zb_meaning(F_n,k,n,zb_cert,zb_rec)

It spells out the meaning of one of the elements 
in the output of "parGosper" or "Zeilberger", i.e. 
something of the form "[zb_cert,zb_rec]"

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- zb_prove(F_n,k,n,zb_out)

- zb_prove(F_n,k,n) [zb_out is computed by "Zeilberger"]

It writes a proof and DOES A TEST for all the solutions
contained in "zb_out", with level of details depending on the
value of "zb_prove_detail".
"zb_out" must have the same for as the output of
"parGosper" and "Zeilberger".

For example:
"
%i30) res : parGosper(binomial(n,k),k,n,1);
				  k
(%o30) 			    [[---------, [2, - 1]]]
			      n - k + 1
(%i31) zb_prove_detail:PROOF_HIGH;
(%o31) 				       3
(%i32) zb_prove(binomial(n,k),k,n,res);
The result contains one recurrence for  binomial(n, k) :  
  
2 binomial(n, k) - binomial(n + 1, k)  =  
(k + 1) binomial(n, k + 1)   k binomial(n, k)
-------------------------- - ---------------- ; 
	  n - k		        n - k + 1
  
which we can prove by dividing both members of the equality by  binomial(n, k) 
and checking the resulting equality between rational functions. 
Namely it is equivalent to test the equality between:  
      n + 1		    k
2 - ---------  and  1 - --------- 
    n - k + 1	        n - k + 1
  
(%o32) 				     true
"

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- zb_test(zb_in_lst)

It does a test for a list containing 
possible inputs for "parGosper", i.e. 
each element of the list is a quadruple 
of the form: "[F_n,k,k,n,order]".
The level of details shown depend on "zb_prove_detail".

IMPORTANT: This function is testing its own result.

Remark: 
The new version of the package includes some tests for "zb_test"
that contain examples for both "Gosper" and "parGosper" most of which
come from real mathematical problems.
For example, if you have time 
try 
"zb_test(FULL_TEST)"
or if you have less time
"zb_test(EASY_TEST)".
