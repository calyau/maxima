Maxima is a symbolic computation program.  It is full featured,
doing symbolic manipulation of polynomials, matrices, rational
functions, integration, Todd-coxeter, graphing, bigfloats.  It has a
symbolic debugger source level debugger for maxima code.  Maxima is
based on the original Macsyma developed at MIT in the 1970's.
It comes with extensive self tests.

Installation information is available in the file INSTALL. Summary
information about this release can be found in the file NEWS. Detailed

A simple usage example:

(%i1)	pyth:a^2+b^2=c^2;
(%o1)	b^2+a^2=c^2

(%i2)	solve(pyth,a);
(%o2)	[a=-sqrt(c^2-b^2),a=sqrt(c^2-b^2)]

(%i3)	integrate(x*sin(a*x),x);
(%o3)	(sin(a*x)-a*x*cos(a*x))/a^2
