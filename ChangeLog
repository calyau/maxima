	* interfaces/xmaxima/Tkmaxima/Paths.tcl: Set default MAXIMA_USERDIR
	under Windows 98 to $maxima_priv(maxima_prefix)/user. This should
	solve extremely long startup time problems under Windows 98. Thanks
	to paricaud@club-internet.fr. A better understanding of the
	USERDIR/startup time issue is still desirable.
	
	Modify exact capitalization/path separator in PATH addition for
	Windows 98. This fixes one problem which prevented maxima compile
	function from working with GCL.

2003-02-09 16:59  amundson

	generated from Header.tcl.in.

2003-01-05 13:44  amundson

	* src/Makefile.am: Fixes to support pathnames with spaces. Not
	necessarily complete.
	
	The big problem is that automake (1.4-p5, at least) is incompatible
	with path names that contain spaces. Oi.

2003-01-05 13:05  amundson

	* interfaces/xmaxima/win32/Makefile.in: Switch to StarKits for
	windows TCL/TK wrapper.  New install target.

2003-01-05 13:03  amundson

2003-01-05 12:58  amundson

	* interfaces/xmaxima/maxima-icon.ico: This should now be a real
	windows icon. There are still some issues with transparency that I
	do not understand.

2003-01-05 12:57  amundson

	* interfaces/xmaxima/: Makefile.am, Tkmaxima/Header.tcl.in: Include
	icons.	Header.tcl is now generated from Header.tcl.in by autoconf
	in order to get wish executable name.

2003-01-05 12:55  amundson

	* interfaces/emacs/emaxima/Makefile.am: Include emaxima.lisp.

2003-01-05 12:53  amundson

	* maxima.spec.in: Added doc files Added explicit clisp version
	Added conditional to postun Renamed exec_* packages to exec-* Use
	rpm macros instead of hard-coded paths Thanks to Rex Dieter for
	helpful suggestions

2003-01-05 12:52  amundson

	* configure.in: Updates for new generated files.  Bumped up version
	number for next release candidate. Note subtle change in number
	scheme (5.9.0rc3 -> 5.9.0.rc4). The new scheme is more likely to be
	automatically recognized by, e.g., rpm.

2003-01-05 12:49  amundson

	* README.rpms: README file to accompany RPM packaging.

2003-01-05 12:49  amundson

2002-10-29 14:28  amundson

	* ChangeLog: Updated for 5.9.0rc3 by cvs2cl.pl.

2002-10-29 12:47  amundson

	* doc/info/Makefile.am: Automake can cause trouble if generated
	make files are not included in tarball. Include maximahtml.mk in
	tarball.

2002-10-29 12:46  amundson

	* maxima.spec.in: Previous version had an ugly hack to create
	uncompressed info files. The hack caused info files to be deleted
	when upgrading the RPMS.
	
	We now have a new ugly (but less ugly!) hack to avoid compressing
	the info files.

2002-10-29 12:43  amundson

	* configure.in: Update for rc3.

2002-10-28 15:28  amundson

	* ChangeLog: ChangeLog updated by cvs2cl.pl.

2002-10-28 12:22  amundson

	* doc/info/Makefile.am: Last minute packaging problem discovered
	and fixed: Elliptic.texi was not included in the distribution
	tarball. Now it is.

2002-10-27 20:53  amundson

	* configure.in: Increment version to 5.9.0rc2.

2002-10-27 20:50  amundson

	* src/init-cl.lisp: Fix courtesy Sam Steingold:
	
		* init-cl.lisp (user::run): use `with-simple-restart' for
		CLISP, just like for CMUCL.
		(sys::commands) [CLISP]: do not redefine the internal
	function

2002-10-27 20:47  amundson

	* src/hyp.lisp: Fix courtesy Sam Steingold:
	
	(step7): call `hyp-algv' with a correct number of arguments

2002-10-27 20:43  amundson

	* src/clmacs.lisp: Make double precision numbers default under
	clisp. This change was suggested by Sam Steingold.
	
	Precision in Maxima needs revisiting.

2002-10-27 20:41  amundson

	* src/Makefile.am: Make sure binary-cmucl directories exist before
	invoking cmucl. This change is necessary since maxima.system
	started calling truename for binary-cmucl.

2002-10-27 20:39  amundson

	* lisp-utils/defsystem.lisp: Update package handling for gcl.

2002-10-27 20:33  amundson

	to distribution tarball.

2002-10-27 20:31  amundson

	restore the functionality of xmaxima-local, at least under Unix.

2002-10-27 20:29  amundson

	* README.lisps: Small update on GCL versions.

2002-10-26 21:20  wjenkner

	* src/mdebug.lisp: ITERATE-OVER-BKPTS: Deleting disabled
	breakpoints didn't work and enabling already enabled breakpoints
	effectively deleted them.

2002-10-25 12:03  amundson

	* interfaces/xmaxima/Tkmaxima/RunMaxima.tcl: Very important bug
	fix. The old default version of pid was -1. This was explosively
	dangerous -- if the maxima subprocess failed to start, xmaxima will
	call "kill -1", which results in killing *all* user process on (at
	least) Linux.
	
	The new default version for pid is "none".

2002-10-23 19:03  billingd

	* tests/rtestode.mac: Fix typo in disabled test, then enable it.

2002-10-23 18:57  billingd

	* tests/rtestode.mac: Add tests for ode2() with
	method:xformtoconstcoeff

2002-10-17 17:32  rtoy

	* src/maxima.system: Recent versions of CMUCL need truename to get
	the right location of binary-cmucl.  Don't know if this is a bug in
	CMUCL or defsystem.

2002-10-17 16:32  rtoy

	* src/cl-info.lisp: Fix typo in loop expression.

2002-10-17 16:08  amundson

	* lisp-utils/maxima-run-lisp: Restore large clisp banner at
	startup.

2002-10-16 10:39  belanger

	* interfaces/emacs/emaxima/maxima.el: A "$" was added to a
	skip-chars-backwards command, to deal with commands ending in "$".

2002-10-15 12:34  rtoy

	* src/float.lisp: Bug 623620: -log(-1.0b0) unnormalized
	
	Fixed as suggested by Stavros Macrakis (with minor editing).

2002-10-15 12:11  rtoy

	* src/trigi.lisp: Bug 623384: acoth(-2.0) was computing the wrong
	thing because the formula was wrong.  Fix from Stavros Macrakis.

2002-10-14 11:44  rtoy

	* src/float.lisp: Rev 1.4 incorrectly lifted the multiplication by
	2 outside the loop.  Make it right.

2002-10-10 09:06  amundson

	* src/macsys.lisp: This change fixes the "socket bug." Error
	conditions often result in a (throw 'maxima-quit) which results in
	macsyma-top-level being restarted. The way the batch mode worked,
	restarting macsyma-top-level caused the input to revert to the
	batch string (used to start the server) which had now reached its
	end. Since there was an eof on the input stream, maxima would
	simply exit. Now, if we are using a socket connection and if the
	input is not standard input, we switch the input to standard input.
	(The socket connection points standard input to the socket.)
	
	The very fact that this commit message is terribly confusing means
	that the entire input-stream/socket/batch-mode scheme needs to be
	rethought.

2002-10-08 12:06  rtoy

	* src/float.lisp: o Fix bug in fpshift wherein right shifts of
	negative numbers were not   truncated properly o Add some comments
	on the algorithm used by fplog.  o Move the multiplication by 2
	that was inside the loop to outside the   loop.

2002-10-07 09:15  amundson

	* NEWS, README: Documentation updates in preparation for release.

2002-10-06 21:30  amundson

	* .cvsignore, interfaces/xmaxima/win32/.cvsignore: Ignore more
	generated files.

2002-10-06 21:16  amundson

	* maxima.spec.in: 1) Enable all three lisps.
	
	2) Build maxima-xmaxima package.

2002-10-06 21:07  amundson

	* share/trigonometry/trgsmp.mac: This file was inadvertently left
	out of the new version of the Maxima source tree.

2002-10-06 17:00  amundson

	* README.lisps: Updated information for Clisp 2.30. Pointer to
	ledit.

2002-10-06 06:29  vvzhy

	* share/Makefile.am: Install diag.dem and battex.sty

2002-10-06 06:26  vvzhy

	* share/contrib/diag.dem: demo file to diag.mac

2002-10-06 06:21  vvzhy

	* share/physics/battex.sty: battex.sty is required by dimension.tex

2002-10-05 20:27  wjenkner

	* src/autol.lisp: $aload_mac: Substitute $load for $batchload,
	which can't load translated/compiled files.  This makes no
	difference unless the user changes the default $FILE_SEARCH_MAXIMA
	accordingly, too.

2002-09-29 02:27  vvzhy

	* interfaces/emacs/emaxima/Makefile.am: remove maxima-symbols.el
	from Makefile.am since it is no longer in the repository

2002-09-28 02:06  billingd

	* tests/rtest15.mac: Rework compile test to ensure f is killed

2002-09-27 15:47  belanger

	* interfaces/emacs/emaxima/maxima.el: A problem with indentation in
	perhaps-smart indentation was fixed.

2002-09-27 15:08  belanger

	* interfaces/emacs/emaxima/maxima.el: Some problems with
	indentation were fixed (I hope).

2002-09-27 11:07  belanger

	* doc/maximabook/interfaces/interfaces.tex: An update to
	indentation information was made.

2002-09-27 11:06  belanger

	* doc/emaxima/: EMaximaIntro.tex, EMaximaIntro.ps: A correction to
	indentation information was made.

2002-09-27 10:54  belanger

	* interfaces/emacs/emaxima/maxima.el: A problem was fixed where the
	maxima process in xemacs would be killed.  Newlines and indents
	were changed to be standard emacs	 (RET is newline,	 
	C-j is newline-and-indent)

2002-09-27 10:52  belanger

	* interfaces/emacs/emaxima/maxima-font-lock.el: A problem was fixed
	where keywords within strings and comments were highlighted.

2002-09-26 21:49  wjenkner

	* src/rat3e.lisp: Fix CONTENT of constant polynomials: content(a,x)
	should give [a, 1] (or [-a, -1]) and not [1, a].  Note that `a' is
	here regarded as (constant) polynomial in x with coefficients in
	Z[a].

2002-09-26 19:33  wjenkner

	* share/simplification/facexp.mac: COLLECTTERMS0: Get rid of FDUM. 
	This permits to remove the quote from the lambda expression near
	the end (by avoiding case II A in trans3.lisp, which the translator
	can't handle yet).  Alternatively, FDUM could be bound inside the
	lambda expression, but calling FIRST twice won't introduce that
	much overhead.
	
	Merge facex1.mac into facexp.mac.  This implies only cosmetic
	changes:
	
	Replace APPLY('COLLECTTERMS,CONS(?,??)) by COLLECTTERMSL(?,??),
	which is equivalent and more concise.
	
	Do NOT replace ORPARTITION(?,??,???) by ORPARTITIONL(?,??,[???]). 
	These two expressions are equivalent (provided that my definition
	in genut.mac is correct).
	
	Do NOT replace LOPPLUSP by its definition (which is in facexp.mac,
	anyway).

2002-09-26 16:22  belanger

	* interfaces/emacs/emaxima/maxima-font-lock.el: A line was added
	for xemacs compatibility.

2002-09-26 15:40  belanger

	* doc/emaxima/EMaximaIntro.ps: The requirement of maxima-symbols.el
	was removed.

2002-09-26 15:40  belanger

	* doc/emaxima/EMaximaIntro.tex: A mention of maxima-symbols was
	removed.

2002-09-26 15:38  belanger

	* doc/maximabook/interfaces/interfaces.tex: Some of the keystrokes
	for maxima-mode were updated.

2002-09-26 15:34  belanger

	* doc/emaxima/EMaximaIntro.ps: Some keystrokes for commands were
	updated.

2002-09-26 15:33  belanger

	* doc/emaxima/EMaximaIntro.tex: Some keystrokes for old commands
	were updated.

2002-09-26 15:26  belanger

	* interfaces/emacs/emaxima/maxima.el: The function maxima-mark-form
	was rebound to M-h.  Either maxima-complete or
	maxima-dynamic-complete is now bound to M-TAB, depending on the
	value of maxima-use-dynamic-complete.

2002-09-26 15:24  belanger

	* interfaces/emacs/emaxima/maxima-symbols.el: The variable
	maxima-symbols was defined in maxima-font-lock.el, making this file
	unnecessary.

2002-09-26 15:17  belanger

	* interfaces/emacs/emaxima/maxima-font-lock.el: The faces used in
	font-locking were changed to default font-lock faces.  Different
	levels of highlighting were introduced.  The variable
	maxima-symbols was put into this file.

2002-09-25 20:14  billingd

	* tests/rtestode.mac: Update reference for Postel and Zimmermann

2002-09-25 08:48  billingd

	* tests/rtestode.mac: Comment out a number of tests that fail when
	this test is run last.	There is some interaction with tests in
	other files.
	
	Add some tests from Postel and Zimmerman ODE testsuite.

2002-09-25 08:47  billingd

	* tests/rtest15.mac: Rename function in compile test from f to
	ffffcompile.  The name f is not killed, and breaks a test in
	rtestode.

2002-09-24 21:17  amundson

	* tests/tests.lisp: Run rtestode last. Otherwise, it interferes
	with two other tests.
	
	This, in itself, deserves investigation, but it will have to be
	investigated after 5.9.0.

2002-09-24 21:10  amundson

	* src/Makefile.am: Fixed gcl alt link so that it actually compiles
	before it tries to link. Duh.

2002-09-24 21:07  amundson

	* interfaces/xmaxima/Makefile.am: Automatically create
	Tkmaxima/tclIndex if tclsh is available. If tclsh is not available,
	create an empty file. In this way we avoid requiring tclsh for the
	build.

2002-09-24 21:04  amundson

	* configure.in: Minor updates. If gcl alt link is enabled, say so.
	Quote the names of lisp and wish executables so that it is more
	obvious is they are left empty.

2002-09-24 21:02  amundson

	* Makefile.am: Make the "dist" dependency optional.

2002-09-24 15:09  belanger

	* interfaces/emacs/emaxima/maxima.el: The help buffer was changed
	to be read only.

2002-09-24 14:53  belanger

	* interfaces/emacs/emaxima/maxima.el: maxima-help was fixed so that
	it now works with xemacs.

2002-09-24 11:56  amundson

	* src/maxima.in: If the default lisp image, as defined at configure
	time, is not present, the maxima script will now make the first
	lisp image it finds the default lisp.

2002-09-23 21:38  mikeclarkson

	* interfaces/bin/xmaxima.iss: Untested improvements to Inno script

2002-09-23 19:46  mikeclarkson

	* interfaces/tex/EMaxima/: EMIntro.ps, EMIntro.tex, Makefile,
	Readme.txt, emaxima.sty, pdfcolmk.sty: Added Readme.txt

2002-09-23 19:32  mikeclarkson

	* interfaces/tex/Xmaxima/: .cvsignore, Makefile, Xmaxima.tex,
	maxima.perl, maxima.sty: Added shell for an Xmaxima users guide

2002-09-23 14:31  belanger

	* interfaces/emacs/emaxima/maxima.el: I updated `maxima-info-dir'.

2002-09-21 22:20  mikeclarkson

	* interfaces/lib/tcllib-1.2/modules/: dns/dns.man, dns/dns.tcl,
	log/log.n, log/log.tcl, log/log.test, log/pkgIndex.tcl,
	uri/pkgIndex.tcl, uri/uri.n, uri/uri.tcl, uri/uri.test,
	uri/urn-scheme.tcl, uri/urn.test: Added tcllib files for asnyc DNS
	in lib

2002-09-21 22:16  mikeclarkson

	* interfaces/: Readme.txt, tex/EMaxima/EMIntro.ps,
	tex/EMaxima/EMIntro.tex, tex/EMaxima/Makefile,
	tex/EMaxima/emaxima.sty, tex/EMaxima/pdfcolmk.sty: Added EMaxima
	documentation in tex

2002-09-20 22:03  wjenkner

	* doc/info/Expressions.texi: Update documentation for DISOLATE.

2002-09-20 22:00  wjenkner

	* doc/info/Simplification.texi: Update documentation for functions
	from facsum and stopex.
	
	Replace the Fortran-like notation `**' by '^'.

2002-09-20 21:38  wjenkner

	* src/max_ext.lisp: Enable autoloading for some functions from
	stopex, facexp, disol, declin and genut (most of which are
	referenced in the manual).
	
	Also intern here some user-level variables defined in these files
	in order to avoid case sensitivity problems (e.g.,
	nextlayerfactor:true$ should bind $nextlayerfactor and not
	|$nextlayerfactor|).  Declaiming them special is more useful than
	just interning them.

2002-09-20 21:24  wjenkner

	* share/simplification/genut.mac: IFLOPMAP: Treat factors of EXP
	which are integer powers in exactly the same way as other products.
	 This is relevant for the NEXTLAYERFACTOR switch.  For example,
	facsum(x^2+2*x+1,'nextlayerfactor,[x]) gave the same result as
	facsum(x^2+2*x+1,[x]).	Compare this with
	facsum(x^2+x,'nextlayerfactor,[x]).  Added genut_prodmap in order
	to deal with this issue.

2002-09-20 07:48  billingd

	* tests/rtestode.mac: Activate additional tests.  For some reason
	they failed if this test is run after rtest3.mac
	
	Add desolve tests.

2002-09-20 07:47  billingd

	* tests/tests.lisp: Run rtestode first.  If it is run after rtest3
	then it breaks.

2002-09-19 23:40  billingd

	* tests/: rtestode.mac, Makefile.am, tests.lisp: Add ODE tests in
	rtestode.mac

2002-09-19 16:42  mikeclarkson

	* interfaces/xmaxima/Tkmaxima/: Browser.tcl, Myhtml.tcl,

2002-09-16 12:55  mikeclarkson

	* interfaces/xmaxima/Tkmaxima/RunMaxima.tcl: Bug fix - thanks Mike
	Thomas

2002-09-14 19:33  amundson

	* maxima.spec.in: Improvements: dependencies improved, packages
	renamed. Info files not compressed through an ugly hack in post
	scripts. Which lisp(s) to use controlled by the variables at the
	head.
	
	Todo: split out xmaxima.

2002-09-14 12:25  mikeclarkson

	* interfaces/xmaxima/: demos.html, examples.html,

2002-09-14 12:25  mikeclarkson

	* interfaces/xmaxima/xmaxima.tcl: Back out height/width change - it
	breaks plotting

2002-09-13 20:07  amundson

	* lisp-utils/defsystem.lisp: Ooops. Previous commit broke non-gcl
	builds. This is the fix.

2002-09-13 12:42  mikeclarkson

	* interfaces/xmaxima/Tkmaxima/: Plot2d.tcl, Plot3d.tcl, Prefs.tcl:
	Gather constants into maxima_priv and maxima_default

2002-09-13 12:40  mikeclarkson

	* interfaces/xmaxima/Tkmaxima/Wmenu.tcl: Bulletproofing - ballons
	are still being called even if show_balloons is 0

2002-09-13 12:39  mikeclarkson

	* interfaces/xmaxima/Tkmaxima/: OpenMath.tcl, RunMaxima.tcl: Signal
	socket failures to the user - maxima has died

2002-09-13 12:38  mikeclarkson

	* interfaces/xmaxima/xmaxima-paths.tcl: Try to get xmaxima to
	handle spaces in directory names - only part of the problem

2002-09-13 09:41  amundson

	* src/Makefile.am: First attempt at gcl-alt-link from Camm. There
	is still probably work to be done with this linking step. The $()
	syntax should be changed to `` at the very least.

2002-09-13 09:40  amundson

	* lisp-utils/defsystem.lisp: Addition from Camm. Needed by
	gcl-alt-link, but usable without it.

2002-09-13 09:39  amundson

	* .cvsignore, xmaxima-local, xmaxima-local.in: xmaxima-local is now
	a generated file. It uses wish as defined by configure.

2002-09-13 09:35  amundson

	* configure.in: 1) misfeature fix: --with-clisp will now enable
	clisp with the standard executable. Formerly, it would have set the
	clisp executable to the empty string. (The intended form is
	--with-clisp=myclisp.) Ditto for CMUCL, GCL.
	
	2) Add wish option.
	
	3) Add gcl-alt-link option.

2002-09-12 02:59  mikeclarkson

	* interfaces/xmaxima/Tkmaxima/: Browser.tcl, Fonts.tcl: Move font
	constants from Browser.tcl

2002-09-12 02:11  mikeclarkson

	* interfaces/bin/xmaxima.iss: Checked in xmaxima.iss from CY -

2002-09-12 01:58  mikeclarkson

	* interfaces/xmaxima/xmaxima-paths.tcl: Look for maxima.exe on
	windows in lib/ - need autoconf(lisp) so we dont need to use glob

2002-09-11 09:38  amundson

	* interfaces/xmaxima/Makefile.am: Tkmaxima directory is now
	installed into verpkglibdir.

2002-09-10 20:19  mikeclarkson

	* interfaces/xmaxima/xmaxima-paths.tcl: Dont set MAXIMA_DIRECTORY

	More on the problem. Although the previous patch I send solves this
	problem.  There are deeper problems in the algorithm which appear
	if one tries h(x,y):=x*y*diff(f(x,y),x,1,y,1); integrate(h(x,y),x);
	integrate(h(x,y),y);
	
	One gets:					   /	   2	   
			   [	 d (D2) 		    (I x (-----
	(f(x, y))) dx) y			   ]	dx dy		   
		    / and					    2	   
				    x f(x, y ) (D3)			   
	     ---------- 				      2
	respectively.
	
	After applying my previous patch the second result looks better but
	it is still wrong.				       d	 2 
				       x (-- (f(x, y   )))		   
			  dx  (D3)			    
	-----------------				    2
	
	This time the problem does not lie in checkderive1 but in rat10. 
	To realize it, it is a good idea to simultaneously trace:
	integrator, powerlist and rat10. There is a call to powerlist close
	to the end of integrator which returns nil when one integrates over
	x and a different expresion where the ((RAT SIMP) 1 2) has already
	appeared when the integration is performed over y. In the end, that
	difference arises from a call to rat10 which returns nil in the
	first situation and t in the other one.
	
	My proposal to solve this last problem is the following patch:
	__________________ 475c478,485 <       (T (RAT10 (CAR (MARGS
	EX)))))) - ---
	>	(T
	>	     (let ((examine (margs ex)))
	>	       (if (atom (first examine))
	>		 (do* ((element examine (rest element))
	>			 (result (rat10 (first examine))
	>				   (and result (rat10 (first
	element)))))
	>			((or (null result) (null element)) result))
	>		 (rat10 (first examine)))))))
	___________________ which affects the last condition considered in
	rat10. The present version recursively searchs in the car of the
	list of arguments which is good if such list is nested but not if
	the list is flat. The different behaviour is appreciated when a
	recursive call to rat10 with arguments (|$x| |$y|) is made.  With
	the present code, only |$x| is compared with the variable of
	integration. My patch forces to compare all arguments, when the
	first of them is an atom, and stops if there is someone which
	returns nil, passing up that nil whose meaning is that there is
	some argument "alike1" the variable the integration.  - -- Juan

	The line numbers may be changed in your file as I have already
	applied Jenkner's patch. Anyway, the problem lies in the function
	checkderiv1 and the patch begins in its sixth line.
	
	It is very instructive to make to_lisp(); (trace sinint
	checkderiv1) and look at what is happening with maxima compiled
	with cmucl18d because gcl hides a recursive call in checkderiv1. On
	the other hand, to realize that the problem was inside checkderiv1,
	I had to trace the algorithm with gcl, as cmucl does not like to
	trace many functions of maxima.
	
	I think now that the use of different compilers to test maxima code
	is one of the best tools to debug it, as each one covers up the
	troubles of the other.	-- Juan Pablo Hierro Álvarez hierro en

	MAXIMA_USERDIR. The default value is the $HOME/.maxima.
	
	3) The internal variable MAXIMA_VERPKGDATADIR was added to allow
	maxima-local to use the share directory from the source tree.

	specify a shell if desired. The shell is used for the maxima script
	only.

2002-06-24 17:15  rtoy

	* src/cl-info.lisp: SHOW-INFO was sometimes returning too much
	documentation because pat-subnode was looking for uppercase
	letters.  We really want to do a case-insensitive search.  Thus,
	things like "operator", "special variable", etc., will stop the
	documentation as well as a "Function".

2002-06-24 16:42  rtoy

	* src/plot.lisp: Fix for Bug 572668:
	
	o Don't compile this file with safety = 0.  o We need to make sure
	that result of coerce-float-fun actually   returns a double-float,
	so coerce it to a double-float.  o $PLOT3D was not passing on the
	list of variables to coerce-float-fun	to create the desired
	function.

2002-06-24 13:01  rtoy

	* src/mtrace.lisp: o MAKE-TRACE-HOOK was returning lists when it

2002-06-20 21:00  billingd

	* tests/rtest15.mac: Add testcase for maxima-Bugs-541993 - trigrat

	* common.mk: fixed non-portable shell construct

2002-06-20 13:20  amundson

	* doc/info/Makefile.am: added MAXIMAHTML = before including
	maximahtml.mk (with MAXIMAHTML +=) in order to keep automake happy.

2002-06-19 13:30  amundson

	* archive/share/lisp/: elim-LISP.lisp, elim.LISP, fourie-LISP.lisp,
	fourie.LISP, ntrig-LISP.lisp, ntrig.LISP: files renamed to avoid
	having names that differ only by case, which causes problems on
	Windows.

2002-06-19 13:26  amundson

	* configure.in: Fixes for problems with path names when no explicit
	--prefix is given to configure. Autoconf is amazingly stupid about
	the various standard path names.

2002-06-19 12:39  rtoy

	* src/mactex.lisp: Define strcat for all Lisps.

2002-06-18 11:29  rtoy

	* src/plot.lisp: o As in rev 1.13, we make the defstruct for
	polygon outside of   eval-when for all Lisps.  (Without this, CMUCL
	can't do 3-D plots.) o Also change the :constructor for polygon
	from make-polygon to   %make-polygon.  o The macro make-polygon
	seems to work just fine on CMUCL now.

2002-06-17 14:23  amundson

	* tests/Makefile.am: All tests are now run with stdin redirected to
	/dev/null, so a failure mode which causes maxima to expect input
	will no longer just sit there.

2002-06-17 14:23  vvzhy

	* src/kclmac.lisp: errset macro fix (for errcatch command) for new

2002-06-17 14:20  amundson

	* maxima-local, src/init-cl.lisp, src/plot.lisp: omplotdata and

	maxima-local now finds them locally.

2002-06-17 14:16  amundson

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, plotting/Makefile.am: omplotdata and
	mgnuplot now installed in verpkglibexecdir.

2002-06-17 14:16  amundson

	* interfaces/xmaxima/Makefile.am, interfaces/xmaxima/omplotdata,

2002-06-15 17:53  rtoy

	* src/cl-info.lisp: o Add a little more documentation o Delete the
	old, unused version of SHOW-INFO.  o Fix the problem where
	describe(plot2d) just printed out the function	 without the actual
	documentation.

2002-06-15 16:01  rtoy

	* src/plot.lisp: o Make the default range on Y much larger so that
	we don't just clip   the output.  If the user wants a clipped plot,
	let him specify the   clipping explicitly.  o When using gnuplot
	for plotting, the output data file sometimes   contains lines with
	the string "move".  Gnuplot doesn't like that,	 so don't do it.

2002-06-15 09:14  rtoy

	* src/maxima.system: Add dependency of the slatec module on
	f2cl-lib and packages modules.

	* share/tensor/ctensr.mac: Bug fix from Valerij Pipin. Here is an
	excerpt from his mail message:
	
	---------------------------------------- The function "motion(dis)"
	computes the covariant form of the geodesic equations of the motion
	for a given metric.  However in "ctensr.mac" we see
	
	motion(dis):=block([s],depends(omega,s),   for i thru dim do	
	em[i]:if diagmetric	  then ratsimp(1/2*sum(        
	diff(lg[a,a],omega[i])		   *diff(omega[a],s)^2,a,1,dim))   
	   else 1/2*sum(sum(diff(lg[a,b],omega[i])			   
	  *diff(omega[a],s)*diff(omega[b],s),a, 		      
	1,dim),b,1,dim),		if dis#false then for i thru dim do
	ldisplay(em[i]),done)$
	
	It does not correspond the definition. I propose to it change to
	
	motion(dis):=block([s],depends(omega,s),   for i thru dim do	
	em[i]:if diagmetric	  then ratsimp(lg[i,i]*diff(omega[i],s,2)+ 
	      
	sum(diff(lg[i,i],omega[a])*diff(omega[i],s)*diff(omega[a],s),a,1,di
	m)-	     1/2*sum( diff(lg[a,a],omega[i])
	*diff(omega[a],s)^2,a,1,dim) )	     else ratsimp(
	sum(lg[i,a]*diff(omega[a],s,2),a,1,dim)+	    sum( sum(	   
	       diff(lg[i,b],omega[a])*diff(omega[b],s)*diff(omega[a],s)    
		 -1/2*diff(lg[a,b],omega[i])

	This can be find in any textbook.  After this  the demo given below

	share/specfunctions/specfun.mac, share/specfunctions/specfun.usg,
	share/specfunctions/test_specfun.mac,
	share/specfunctions/variational_method.dem: Updated to specfun from
	Barton Willis.
	
	Excerpt from his mail message:
	
	------------------------------- specfun-110.tar.gz  --- I fixed
	some problems with the gradef statements and the documentation.  
	The files specfun.mc and specfun.texi in this archive should
	replace the files Maxima currently uses.  If you like quantum
	mechanics, you may enjoy the two demonstration programs. 
	-------------------------------
	
	His changelog:
	
	Changes version 110 to version 111
	---------------------------------- 12 April 2001
	
	Bug: For the series representation, the sum index is m; when the
	order is m (and m declared to be an integer), we've got trouble. 
	Maybe make the sum index be i%.
	
	Fix: Changing 'm to i%	 fixed the problem; added additional
	documentation warning against using i% as a function argument.
	
	--------------------------------- 13 April 2001
	
	Bug: Text comment in test_specfun: print("Taylor may will print...;
	
	Fix: changed to print("Taylor may print...;
	
	---------------------------------- 17 April 2001
	
	Bug: "Merzbacher" incorrectly spelled in source code comments.
	
	Fix:  changed Mertzbacher to Merzbacher.
	
	---------------------------------- 17 April 2001
	
	Bug: "its should" in source code comment.
	
	Fix: changed to "it should".
	
	---------------------------------- 17 April 2001
	
	Bug: In test_specfun, test name "A&S 22.2.12.5" should be "A&S
	22.2.12.5".
	
	Fix: Changed test name.
	
	---------------------------------- 17 April 2001
	
	Bug: specfun package shouldn't include ai.lisp; should use ai.lisp
	from Maxima's cvs.
	
	Fix: removed ai.lisp from specfun-110.
	
	---------------------------------- 18 April 2001
	
	Bug: Not really a bug, but spherical_hankel2 has the code
	
		  w : 1,
		  for m : 0 thru n do (
		       w : w * (n + m + 1) * (n - m) / (2 * %i * x *  (m +
	1)),
		       sofar : sofar + w
		  ),
	
	when m = n,  w is zero.  This is silly.
	
	Fix:  Changed code to
	
		  w : 1,
		  for m : 1 thru n do (
		       w : w * (n + m) * (n - m + 1) / (2 * %i * x *  m),
		       sofar : sofar + w
		  ),
	
	Also,  added additional tests A&S 10.1.20  and A&S 10.1.31 to
	test_specfun.
	
	---------------------------------- 18 April 2001
	
	Bugs:  gradef statements have bogus quotes.  Further, the gradef
	for assoc_legendre_p has a typo.
	
	Fix: Removed bogus quotes from gradef statements and fixed the typo
	in the gradef for assoc_legendre_p.
	
	Comment:  Bug only showed up running test_specfun in interpreted
	mode.
	
	---------------------------------- 18 April 2001
	
	Bugs:  assoc_legendre_q and legendre_q have no gradefs but
	test_specfun has gradef tests for them.
	
	Fix: removed the tests from test_specfun.
	
	Comment:  Bug only showed up running test_specfun in interpreted
	mode.
	
	---------------------------------- 18 April 2001
	
	Bug:  Yikes! featurep(-1, integer) is true;  my statements
	
	(integerp(n) and n > -1) or  featurep(n, 'integer)
	
	are true when n is a negative integer.	This isn't what I want.
	
	Fix: Change above to
	
	(integerp(n) and n > -1) or (symbolp(n) and featurep(n, 'integer))
	
	---------------------------------- 19 April 2001
	
	Bug: Some gradef statements are trouble when the order is zero; in
	this case, we want to evaluate the polynomials with negative orders
	to zero.
	
	Fix: Multiply potential troublemakers by (1-kron_delta(n,0)).  Thus
	
	kron_delta(i,j) := if (i=j) then 1 else 0;
	
	gradef(jacobi_p(n,a,b,x),	 'diff(jacobi_p(n,a,b,x),n),	   
	 'diff(jacobi_p(n,a,b,x),a),	     'diff(jacobi_p(n,a,b,x),b),   
	     (n*(a-b-(2*n+a+b)*x) * jacobi_p(n,a,b,x)+2*(n+a)*(n+b)	   
	    * (1 - funmake(kron_delta,[0,n])) * jacobi_p(n-1, a, b, x)) /
	((2*n+a+b)*(1-x^2)));
	
	I added  kron_delta to specfun.
	
	------------------- 19 April 2001
	
	Change:  In jacobi_pf, changed np1 from a float to a fixnum.  Thus
	replaced
	
	    np1 : 1.0 + n,
	    for m : 1 thru n do (
		 w : w * (np1 - m) * (abn + m) * x / (m * (a + m)),
		 sofar : sofar + w
	    ),
	
	with
	
	    np1 : 1 + n,
	    for m : 1 thru n do (
		 w : w * (np1 - m) * (abn + m) * x / (m * (a + m)),
		 sofar : sofar + w
	    ),
	
	------------------- 19 April 2001
	
	Bug:  More trouble with gradef statements;  the following code
	causes trouble:
	
	(C1) n : 3;
	
	(D1)				       3 (C2) load("specfun.o");
	
	Loading ./specfun.o Attempt to differentiate with respect to a
	number: 3  -- an error.  Quitting.  To debug this try
	DEBUGMODE(TRUE);)
	
	Another  troublemaker is
	
	(c1) baz : diff(jacobi(n,x,x,x),x);
	
	Then ev(baz,diff) # ev(ev(baz,diff),diff), etc.
	
	Fixes:	Put blocks around gradef statements and  replaced
	unevaluated derivatives with errors. Thus
	
	unk_derivative() := block([ ],	  "error: derivative with respect
	to order is unknown" );
	
	block([n,a,b,x],    gradef(jacobi_p(n,a,b,x),		    
	unk_derivative( ),		  unk_derivative( ),		   
	unk_derivative( ),		  (n*(a-b-(2*n+a+b)*x) *
	jacobi_p(n,a,b,x)+2*(n+a)*(n+b) 	     * (1 -
	funmake(kron_delta,[0,n])) * jacobi_p(n-1, a, b, x)) /
	((2*n+a+b)*(1-x^2))) );
	
	------------------- 21 April 2001
	
	Change:  Removed
	
	eval_when([load, batch, batchload],	 float2bf : true );
	
	and deleted the source code comment about setting float2bf to true
	locally.  I don't remember why I once wanted float2bf to be true.
	
	------------------- 21 April 2001
	
	Change: Clarified source code comment on how to compute
	jacobi_p(n,a,b,x) for integers a, b < 0.
	
	------------------- 21 April 2001
	
	Bug: Maxima doesn't have a bfloat gamma function.  The
	ultraspherical function doesn't evaluate to a bfloat when all
	arguments except the order are bfloats.
	
	Fix:  Replace quotients of gamma functions in ultraspherical by
	genfact functions.   Note
	
	     genfact(x,n,-1) = x (x+1) (x+2) ... (x+n-1)
	
	Also, removed  the remaining gamma function calls in specfun by
	replacing the gamma functions in assoc_legendre_p by factorials. 
	Finally, removed the source code comment about gamma giving an
	error.
	
	Comment:  May need to change specfun.texi on the gamma function
	giving an error.
	
	----------------------- Mon Apr 23 05:11:46 CDT 2001
	
	Bug: gen_laguerre(n,a,x) function not defined for  a <= -1 (see A&S
	22.2.12 page 775); specfun doesn't trap this case.
	
	Fix: added trap for this case
	
	   if (integerp(n) and n > -1) and not (integerp(a) and a < 0) then
	(
	
	----------------------- Mon Apr 23 05:26:21 CDT 2001
	
	Change: In gen_laguerre, replaced
	
	     for m : 1 thru n do (
		 w : -w * x * (n - m + 1) / (m * (m + a)),
		 sofar : sofar + w
	     ),
	
	with
	
	     for m : 1 thru n do (
		 w : w * x * (m -n-1) / (m * (m + a)),
		 sofar : sofar + w
	     ),
	
	This reduced the execution time of  baz :
	sum(gen_laguerre(i,1/8,x),i,0,50)$ by about 33%.
	
	----------------------- Mon Apr 23 06:05:00 CDT 2001
	
	Change: Removed rat from spherical_harmonic:
	
	     rat(exp(%i * m * phi)   * sqrt((2 * n + 1)  * (n - m)! / (4 * 
	%pi *  (n + m)!))
			   * assoc_leg_cos(n, m, theta))
	
	This change dramatically speeds test_specfun and eliminates the
	funny message  "Assumed to be zero in TAYLOR".
	
	----------------------- Mon Apr 23 07:08:37 CDT 2001
	
	Bug: Bogus function call to test_zero_list  instead of
	check_zero_list in  "spherical harmonic orthogonality" test.
	
	Fix: Fixed it.
	
	----------------------- Mon Apr 23 15:57:15 CDT 2001
	
	Change: Eliminated the function `elements'  from test_specfun and
	re-wrote check_zero_list(e).
	
	------------------------ Thu May 3 07:44:00 CDT 2001
	
	Change: Added h-atom.dem and variational_method.dem to the specfun
	distribution.

	* src/mactex.lisp: Utilities for mactex courtesy Barton Willis.
	Excerpts from his mail message:
	
	Here is utility that provides a maxima level interface to putprop.
	Specifically, texput allows a user to change the behavior of
	maxima's tex function.
	
	A few examples.
	
	/* tex mue tex as "\mu_e",  etc  */
	
	(C2) texput(mue, "\\mu_e")$ (C3) texput(e, "\\mathbf{E}")$ (C4)
	texput(b, "\\mathbf{B}")$
	
	/* Let's try it */ (C5) tex([mue,e,b,e.b]); $$\left[
	\mu_e,\mathbf{E},\mathbf{B},\mathbf{E}\cdot \mathbf{B} \right] $$
	(D5)			      FALSE
	
	/* Define a matchfix operator || and tex it as \|.  To do this, use
	three arguments to texput */
	
	(C6) matchfix("||","||")$ (C7) texput("||","\\|","\\|")$ (C8)
	tex(|| e + b ||); $$\|\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{B}\|$$ (D8)		   
		  FALSE
	
	/* One more time.  Before texput */
	
	(C9) matchfix("<<",">>")$ (C10) tex(<<x,y>>);
	$$<<\left(x,y\right)$$ (D10)			     FALSE (C11)
	texput("<<","\\langle ", " \\rangle ")$
	
	/* after texput */
	
	(C12) tex(<<x,y>>); $$\langle x,y \rangle $$ (D12)		   
	       FALSE (C13) tex(<<x>>); $$\langle x \rangle $$ (D13)	   
			FALSE
	
	1.  I wrote this function this morning; it hasn't been thoroughly
	tested.  Let me know if you see any problems with it.
	
	2.  Commercial Macsyma used qput to do the same thing; it seemed to
	me that I'd have to modify mactex.lisp	in a handful of places to
	use qput in this way.

	Attached is a first pass of Lindstedt code, which has the same
	calling sequence as the commercial function, for inclusion in the
	maxima project.  I gave it the LGPL, but I can change that to the
	GPL if required.  I would appreciate any comments about my coding
	style, as well as other comments.

2002-06-09 16:25  amundson

	* src/sin.lisp, tests/rtest15.mac: Bug fix for integrate(3^log(x))
	problem. Fix thanks to Wolfgang Jenkner with suggestions from
	Richard Fateman. The test was modified to accept the form produced
	by maxima after the fix. Previously, the test looked for a
	different, but equivalent, answer.

	* src/bessel.lisp: o Tell maxima that J[v](0) is 0 except when v =
	0 where it is 1.  o Tell maxima how to differentiate the Bessel
	functions.

2002-05-26 15:00  rtoy

	* src/bessel.lisp: As discussed on the mailing list, the Bessel
	functions are called BESSEL_{J,Y,I,K} instead of %J, %Y, %IBES, %K.

2002-05-22 17:15  rtoy

	* tests/rtest6a.mac: Undo last change.	The real bug was an error
	in %j.

2002-05-22 16:13  rtoy

	* tests/rtest14.mac: Undo the previous change.	The assumptions
	aren't needed and were caused by an error in the simplifier for %j.

2002-05-22 16:05  rtoy

	* src/bessel.lisp: $realpart and/or $imagpart was causing
	%j[1](sqrt(x)) to ask for the sign of x.  Don't do that.  (Fix
	applied to all of the Bessel routines.)

2002-05-21 21:53  rtoy

	* tests/rtest14.mac: Correct the value for bessel(2,3).

2002-05-21 21:34  rtoy

	* src/bessel.lisp: o Add $BESSELEXPAND variable to control whether
	to expand the Bessel   functions of half-integral order in terms of

2002-05-19 22:14  rtoy

	* src/bessel.lisp: o Fix a few typos in bessel-y o Was incorrectly
	computing the half-integral order Bessel functions   when the arg
	wasn't a simple variable.  o Clean up and improve some of the
	comments.  o Do the half-integral order expansions whenever the
	order is   half-integral, even if the arg is a number.	o Clean up,
	comment, and correct the expander for half-integral %K.

2002-05-19 15:31  rtoy

	* src/bessel.lisp: o Rename the Bessel J function from bessel_j to
	%j, and Y from	 bessel_y to %y, since maxima already has %j and %y
	defined.    Likewise for Bessel I, use %ibes.  o Call the Bessel K
	function %k.  Add support for it.  o For order 0 and 1, call the
	specialized dbesj0 and dbesj1 functions   instead of the general
	dbesj function.  o Use analytic continuation so we can evaluate the
	J for negative	 values of the argument.  o Do similar things for
	Bessel Y.  o Was not correctly expanding the Bessel J, Y, and I
	functions for	half-integral orders.

2002-05-19 15:25  rtoy

	* src/gcl-depends.mk: Regenerated.

	in our max functions, so don't	 declare the variables.  o GCL
	doesn't like our defparameter for *lun-hash*.  Make it defvar.	o
	GCL doesn't have least-positive-normalized-double-float, so   make
	it the same as least-positive-double-float.  Do likewise for  
	single-float.

	CLOCC	(clocc.sourceforget.net) which uses the fast Ziggurat
	method to   generate Gaussian random vars.  o Tell maxima how to
	differentiate bessel_j.  o Remove some old simplifiers for Bessel Y
	and I functions.  o Fix error in simplifiers for J, Y, and I:  when
	checking to see if   the order was a half-integer, we were
	accidentally setting the order	 to NIL when it wasn't a

	routines for Bessel Y and I functions.

2002-05-07 23:51  rtoy

	* src/bessel.lisp: First cut at Bessel Y and I function support:
	
	o Clean up some comments o Add functions to numerically evaluate Y
	and I functions.  Still   needs some work.  (Should all of the
	additional values be stored in	 $besselarray or should we have a
	different variable for each?) o Add the new maxima functions
	bessel_j[v](z), bessel_y[v](z), and   bessel_i[v](z).  Can express
	these functions in terms of elementary	 functions when v is half
	of an odd integer.  (Should this expansion   be controllable by
	some user variable?) o bessel(x,n) for symbolic x and n is
	converted to bessel_j[n](x).

2002-05-07 23:45  rtoy

	* src/maxima.system: Add rules for the Bessel I functions for
	complex arg and Bessel Y functions.for real and complex args.

2002-05-07 23:44  rtoy

	wasn't being computed as accurately as it should   have.

2002-05-04 14:20  rtoy

	* configure.in: When printing out help, make the help strings line
	up neatly.

2002-05-04 14:16  rtoy

	Defsystem file for building the Lisp files from the Fortran files.

2002-05-02 21:18  amundson

	* configure.in: Bug fix. If the user specifies one or more lisps at
	configure time, configure should not search for other lisps. Now it
	doesn't.

2002-05-01 13:20  amundson

	* src/numerical/: f2cl-package.lisp, slatec.lisp: Package-related
	hacks for gcl.

2002-05-01 12:57  amundson

	* maxima-local: added infodir so that info can be used locally.

2002-04-30 13:04  rtoy

	* lisp-utils/make-depends.lisp: Generate multiple lines for the
	dependency file instead of one very long line.	(Solution by James
	Amundson, to work around a line-length limit in some utilities.)

2002-04-29 11:17  amundson

	needed by gcl.

2002-04-29 09:14  amundson

	*maxima-directory*. *info-paths* is now set by set-pathnames.

2002-04-29 08:27  rtoy

	* src/: bessel.lisp, numerical/slatec.lisp: Oops.  ZBESJ needs to
	exported from the SLATEC package, and we need to use it.

2002-04-28 16:29  amundson

	* xmaxima-local: New script. xmaxima-local is a wrapper to run
	xmaxima without running make install first.

2002-04-28 16:25  amundson

	* src/todd-coxeter.lisp: Bug fix:
	
	From:	Juan Pablo Hierro Álvarez <BUSCAIDEAS@terra.es> To:    
	maxima@www.ma.utexas.edu Subject:	[Maxima] Installation
	instruction and a small bug.  Date:	  13 Apr 2002 09:58:49
	+0200 First, I think there is a small bug in the file
	todd-coxeter.lisp The patch would be 5c5 < (proclaim '(type (vector
	t)  $todd_coxeter_state)) ---
	> (proclaim '(type (vector (t))  $todd_coxeter_state))
	21c21 <     (declare (fixnum nvars) (type (vector t)
	multiply-table)) ---
	>     (declare (fixnum nvars) (type (vector (t)) multiply-table))
	
	With the original version (vector (t)), it complains that the type
	(t) is not defined. But t is, of course, a type by itself.

2002-04-28 16:21  amundson

	* src/: init-cl.lisp, macsys.lisp, maxima.in: New system for
	communicating maxima command line options to lisp.
	
	maxima command line options have changed. see maxima --help.
	
	Fixes for "let/setq" problems with environment variables.

2002-04-28 16:17  amundson

	* interfaces/xmaxima/Makefile.am: Removed spurious reference to
	maxima.(png,gif)

2002-04-28 16:16  amundson

	* src/Makefile.am: Update saving of init functions. Only clisp now
	has init function specified.

2002-04-28 16:13  amundson

	* share/Makefile.am: install physics/physconst.mac and
	physics/physconst.usg

2002-04-28 16:12  amundson

	* lisp-utils/maxima-run-lisp: Hardcode "(user:run)" for running
	with cmucl, instead of saving it as the init function. This is
	really a big hack. It should be addressed in a more general manner.

2002-04-28 16:08  amundson

	* configure.in: Create autoconf variables file for xmaxima.

2002-04-28 16:07  amundson

	* common.mk: Add xmaximadir.

2002-04-28 16:03  amundson

	* interfaces/xmaxima/xmaxima.tcl: Updates to get xmaxima working
	with new system.  xmaxima now takes several arguments:
	------------------------ |addiator>xmaxima --help usage: xmaxima
	[options] [url] 	   If given, [url] will be opened in the
	help browser instead		of the default starting page. 
	options:     --help: Display this usage message.      -l <lisp>,
	--lisp=<lisp>: Use lisp implementation <lisp>.	   
	--use-version=<version>: Launch maxima version <version>. 
	------------------------
	
	xmaxima now works with the new maxima script. If the new maxima
	script is unavailable, as could be the case on windows, xmaxima
	will attempt to talk directly to a GCL saved image.

2002-04-28 15:57  amundson

	* interfaces/xmaxima/xmaxima.tcl: Under some circumstances xmaxima
	would call kill -1, which kills all processes with pid > 0. This
	lead many people (myself included\!) to believe xmaxima was
	crashing X windows. xmaxima will now never call kill -1. Also
	updated comment for emacs mode discovery and date.

2002-04-28 15:45  amundson

	* interfaces/xmaxima/server.lisp: server from the archive
	directory. getpid functions for clisp and cmucl have been added to
	the original.

2002-04-28 15:44  amundson

	* interfaces/xmaxima/: maxima-icon.ico, maxima-icon.png,
	maxima-new.gif, maxima-new.png: New maxima logo from Cliff Yapp.

2002-04-28 15:43  amundson

	* interfaces/xmaxima/: demos.html, examples.html, intro.html:
	Updates for new maxima logo.

2002-04-28 15:39  amundson

	* interfaces/xmaxima/: .cvsignore, Makefile.am,
	autoconf-variables.tcl.in, xmaxima, xmaxima-paths.tcl,
	xmaxima-trailer.tcl, xmaxima.tcl: xmaxima updates for new file
	layout and new maxima script.  xmaxima itself is now derived from
	several tcl files.

2002-04-26 12:12  rtoy

	* src/bessel.lisp: Remove the original maxima code that was
	evaluating the Bessel functions, to reduce clutter.

2002-04-26 11:54  rtoy

	* src/maxima.system: Forgot to include xgetua.lisp.

2002-04-26 11:23  rtoy

	* src/bessel.lisp: Remove the f2cl macros that were placed here and
	the TOMS algorithms that we've replaced by SLATEC versions.

2002-04-26 11:22  rtoy

	* src/numerical/slatec/README: Update the script for building the
	Lisp files.  Clean up notes.

2002-04-26 11:21  rtoy

	* src/numerical/slatec/dasyik.lisp: Regenerated from Fortran code
	because we receive a sliced array.

2002-04-26 11:20  rtoy

	* src/numerical/slatec/dbesi.lisp: Regenerated from Fortran code
	because we need array-slicing enabled since we slice an array when

2002-04-26 09:16  rtoy

	* src/numerical/slatec/dbesj.lisp: Regenerated from Fortran code

2002-04-26 09:15  rtoy

	* src/numerical/slatec/dasyjy.lisp: Regenerated from Fortran code
	because the array type should be array, not simple-array (because
	we're given an array slice).

2002-04-26 09:13  rtoy

	* src/numerical/slatec/README: Update the build script and say the
	conversion was done using CMUCL.

2002-04-26 08:13  rtoy

2002-04-25 12:11  rtoy

	* src/numerical/slatec/fortran/dasyjy.f: f2cl doesn't handle

2002-04-15 08:33  amundson

	* configure.in, src/autoconf-variables.lisp.in, src/init-cl.lisp:
	Search path updates. Maxima should now be internally consistent
	with the new build system and file installation schemes. All
	autoconf options should be properly supported, including overriding
	datadir and infodir. The autoconf prefix, datadir and infodir
	options are also adjustable at run time through the environment

2002-03-27 13:06  amundson

	* src/commac.lisp: Fix for CMUCL bug in rtest12. Thanks to Ole
	Rohne, who offers the following reservations:
	
	I don't particularly like this fix, because the use of
	COMPILED-FUNCTION-P in KILL1 has nothing to do with a function
	being compiled - on some systems, all functions are compiled. It is
	a kludge to figure out if a function has been loaded from a lisp
	file and it should be renamed accordingly. Being used exactly once
	in all of maxima doesn't justify shadowing a symbol from
	COMMON-LISP

2002-03-27 13:00  amundson

	* src/Makefile.am: Important change. Formerly, we used one lisp
	invocation to compile the system and save the image. We use to lisp
	invocations: one to compile, another to load and save.
	
	Before this change, eval-when problems could cause the code to
	compile differently depending on whether it was a fresh or
	incremental build. After the change all code will be loaded the
	same way before images are saved whether or not a given file needed
	to be compiled.

2002-03-27 12:54  amundson

	* src/bessel.lisp: eval-when change. Needed to include "load" along
	with compile and eval for some functions. Change was needed for gcl
	only, but should not hurt on other compilers.

2002-03-27 12:52  amundson

	* src/hyp.lisp: MABS problem solved once and for all. The macro
	formerly known as MABS is now HYP-MABS.

	of *standard-output*   (as done by Thomas A. Russ).  o Update a
	docstring.  o We forgot to handle the case-insensitive case when we
	have a literal	 string at the beginning of our search pattern.

2002-01-31 23:05  rtoy

	* src/mdebug.lisp: o Make a note of an ANSI CL portability problem.

2002-01-23 16:41  rtoy

	* src/limit.lisp: Richard Fateman says we
	
		don't know for sure than sin/cos would get us into a loop
	if
		it turns back to tan in some simplification process.

	removing %TAN from the list.

2002-01-21 21:34  rtoy
