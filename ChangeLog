Maxima 5.47-post change log
===========================

New items in core:
------------------
 * Print errors and warnings to stderr instead of stdout
 * New command-line option --quit-on-error to make Maxima quit upon first
   runtime error
 * New command-line option --very-very-quiet to silence Maxima
 * New global variable batch_answers_from_file
 * New Unicode display2d and global variable display2d_unicode
 * A new function random-name in plot.lisp that generates a random string
 * New function timer_reset: set accumulated elapsed time to zero
 * New functions float_infinity_p, float_nan_p: recognize float infinity and not-a-number

New items in share:
-------------------
 * New example share/colnew/prob5.mac
 * New package raddenest: radical denesting function
 * New draw terminals: tikz and tikz_standalone
 * ode2 now solves Modified Bessel differential equation
 * Documentation for share/contrib/levin
 * New package guess: guess a formula for a sequence of numbers
 * New package gamma_simp: simplification of gamma function
 * Package descriptive: function cov accepts optional argument for per-datum weights

Changes in core:
----------------
 * Add answers_from_file option to run_testsuite
 * Add rtest_raddenest to share_testsuite_files
 * In src/plot.lisp, clipping is no longer done when plot_format is xmaxima
 * The default y-range for plots is determined only by points within x-range
 * Function chinese renamed to solve_congruences

Changes in share:
-----------------

Changes in Xmaxima:
-------------------
 * Line clipping in plot2d  and plotdf
 * Better integration algorithm for plotdf

Changes in the Windows installer:
---------------------------------
 * Update Gnuplot
 * Update ABCL
 * Update wxMaxima
 * Update wxWidgets
 * Update TCL/TK
 * Update SBCL
 * Support Clozure Common Lisp (for 64 bit installers)
 * Use configured paths to Lisp compilers, this should help,
   if one is building Maxima on Windows (native) and uses
   special paths to the Lisp compilers.
 * Fix calculation of %maxima_prefix% in maxima.bat.in.
