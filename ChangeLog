* new code to commute conjugate of derivative (Commit [565fcf])

Changes in share:
-----------------

Changes in Xmaxima:
-------------------

Changes in the Windows installer:
---------------------------------
 * Update SBCL, wxMaxima, TCL/TK.
   A newer Gnuplot version is available, but causes problems when using
   pipes on Windows, therefore that was not updated.
 * Use the HTML manual (not the PDF version) in the start menu.
 * Strip included C programs (saves some space).
