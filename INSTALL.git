If the file "configure" does not exist, i.e. this is not a Maxima
tarball release, execute the script "./bootstrap", which will do
the necessary auto(conf,make) magic necessary to produce the
"configure" script.

Afterwards further installation instructions are available from
	./configure --help
and the file INSTALL.
