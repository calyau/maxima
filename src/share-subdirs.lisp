;; A default version is checked in, but configure will update this
;; with the correct values.  The default checked in version is useful
;; if you're doing a lisp-only build without configure.  But configure
;; is the preferred way to build.

;; The file isn't directly created as share-subdirs.lisp but with an
;; immediate step in order to make the autotools not delete the file
;; we want to ship with the repo.
