  Collect some values somehow.  Each of the collections specifies a bunch of
  things which collected during the evaluation of the body of the form.  The
  name of the collection is used to define a local macro, a la MACROLET.
  Within the body, this macro will evaluate each of its arguments and collect
  the result, returning the current value after the collection is done.  The
  body is evaluated as a PROGN; to get the final values when you are done, just
  call the collection macro with no arguments.

  Initial-Value is the value that the collection starts out with, which
  defaults to NIL.  Function is the function which does the collection.  It is
  a function which will accept two arguments: the value to be collected and the
  current collection.  The result of the function is made the new value for the
  collection.  As a totally magical special-case, the Function may be Collect,
  which tells us to build a list in forward order; this is the default.  If an
  Initial-Value is supplied for Collect, the stuff will be rplacd'd onto the
  end.  Note that Function may be anything that can appear in the functional
  position, including macros and lambdas."

;; Internal macro to do the heavy lifting of defining a function that
;; checks the number of arguments of a function.  This is intended to
;; give nice error messages to user-callable functions when the number
;; of arguments is incorrect.
;;
;; The function to check arguments is named NAME.  The actual
;; implementation is in a new function named IMPL, which is called by
;; NAME.  A compiler-macro is also defined so that Lisp calls of NAME
;; get automatically converted to IMPL.
;;
;; If the keyword :DEPRECATED-P is also specified, then the function
;; is deprecated which causes a warning to be printed once when the
;; function NAME is called the first time.  The value of :DEPRECATED-P
;; is a symbol naming the function that should be used instead.
;;
;; For example:
;;
;;   (defun-checked-form ($foo foo-impl :deprecated-p $bar) ...)
;;
;;
;; The lambda-list supports &optional and &rest args.  Keyword args
;; (&key) are also supported.  Maxima keyword args (a=b) are converted
;; to Lisp keywords appropriately.  Unrecognized keywords signal a
;; Maxima error.
;;
;; The variable %%PRETTY-FNAME is defined such that the body can refer
;; to this variable to get the pretty name of the defined function for
;; use in printing error messages or what not.  This allows the
;; implementation to print out the function name that would also be
;; used when printing out error messages for incorrect number of
;; arguments.

;; Defines a simplifying function for Maxima whose name is BASE-NAME.
;; The noun and verb properties are set up appropriately, along with
;; setting the operator property.  The noun form is created from the
;; BASE-NAME by prepending a "%"; the verb form, by prepending "$".
;; The verb function is defined appropriately too.
;;
;; For example, let's say we want to define a Maxima function named
;; foo of two args with a corresponding simplifier to simplify special
;; cases or numerically evaluate it.  Then:
;;
;; (def-simplifier foo (x y)
;;   (cond ((float-numerical-eval-p x y)
;;          (foo-eval x y))
;;         (t
;;          (give-up))))
;;
;; This expands to 
;;         
;; (progn
;;   (defprop %foo simp-%foo operators)
;;   (defprop $foo %foo verb)
;;   (defprop %foo $foo noun)
;;   (defprop $foo %foo alias)
;;   (defprop %foo $foo reversealias)
;;   (defun simp-%foo (form #:unused-5230 %%simpflag)
;;     (declare (ignore #:unused-5230))
;;     (let ((x (simpcheck (nth 1 form) #:z-5229))
;;           (y (simpcheck (nth 2 form) #:z-5229)))
;;       (arg-count-check 2 form)
;;       (macrolet ((give-up ()
;;                    '(eqtest (list '(%foo) x y) form)))
;;         (cond
;;           ((float-numerical-eval-p x y)
;;            (foo-eval x y))
;;           (t
;;            (give-up))))))
;;
;; The body can reference FORM and %%SIMPFLAG.
;;
;; The base name can also be a lambda-list of the form (name &key
;; (simpcheck :default)).  The NAME is the BASE-NAME of the
;; simpiflier.  The keyword arg :SIMPCHECK supports two values:
;; :DEFAULT and :CUSTOM, with :DEFAULT as the default.  :CUSTOM means
;; the generated code does not call SIMPCHECK on the args, as shown
;; above.  It is up to the body to do the necessary work.
;;
;; Note also that the args for the simplifier only supports a fixed
;; set of required arguments.  Not optional or rest arguments are
;; supported.  No checks are made for this.  If you need this, you'll
;; have to write your own simplifier.  Use the above macro expansion
;; to see how to define the appropriate properties for the simplifer.
;;
;; Note carefully that the expansion defines a macro GIVE-UP to
;; handle the default case of the simplifier when we can't do any
;; simplification.  Call this in the default case for the COND.
