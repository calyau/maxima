;; Return true if there is pi and pj in the CL list p such that
;; x is between pi and pj.  This means that either pi <= x <= pj or
;; pj <= x <= pi. For example, 2x is between x and 3x.

;; Strangely, sign((a-b)*(b-a)) --> pnz but sign(expand((a-b)*(b-a))) --> nz.
;; To workaround this weirdness, we could call expand instead of factor on 
;; (mul (sub x pk) (sub qk x))), but let's not do that.

;; The betweenp simplification is done last; this has some interesting effects:
;; max(x^2,x^4,x^6,x^2+1) (standard simplification) --> max(x^4,x^6,x^2+1) 
;; (betweenp) --> max(x^4,x^6,x^2+1). If the betweenp simplification were done 
;; first, we'd have max(x^2,x^4,x^6,x^2+1) --> max(x^2,x^6,x^2+1) --> max(x^6,x^2+1).

;; The function $factor refuses to factor an expression that has an exponent that
;; exceeds factor_max_degree. I think this is a better heuristic than the conssize
;; method used by factor-if-small (defined in compar.lisp). So let's use $factor, not
;; factor-if-small. We could locally set the value of factor_max_degree, but let's not.

;; Removing factor from (csign ($factor (mul (sub x pk) (sub qk x))) causes max
;; to miss the simplification max(x^2,x^4,x^6) -->  max(x^2, x^6). Arguably, csign
;; should be more semantically neutral--until it is, let's keep factor in here.
